@1 = ~Aerie... all I can hear is you muttering to yourself when you look my way. If you have a problem with me, please tell me to my face.~
@2 = ~Oh! I... it's nothing Fade... I just... ~
@3 = ~Come on, little fancy, spit it out.~
@4 = ~It's just... just that I've heard of your people, Fade. That they are cruel a-and evil and torture for fun! That they willingly corrupted themselves, simply to gain power. I... sometimes w-wonder about your intention here, that's all.~
@5 = ~I do believe you are casting aspersions on my character based solely upon rumours of my heritage. Or maybe I misinterpreted what you meant... ~
@6 = ~I... I... didn't intend to insult you, Fade, but... you cannot blame me for my caution... I have n-nothing against you personally, but I do sometimes wonder if <CHARNAME> knows about your people. It's something <PRO_HESHE> needs to know about!~
@7 = ~Needs to know? And just who are you to judge this?~
@8 = ~I... I wasn't j-judging you, I w-was just... ~
@9 = ~So exactly what were you doing? (sigh) Aerie, I'm not patronising or berating you. Of course I know how my people are perceived, and believe me, the reality is worse than any rumour. But that doesn't mean we're *all* like that.~
@10 = ~It's the same for your people. What about the Avariel who murdered children, who ate their bloody, still beating hearts from their chests as their life force slipped away?~
@11 = ~N-no!! That n-never h-happened! No Avariel would ever do that!!~
@12 = ~No? How can you be so sure? I've heard such rumours... in fact this particular tale is a favourite amongst my people.~
@13 = ~The point is, just because you belong to a certain caste or race doesn't necessarily mean you all act the same. Your experiences also shape who you are... who you'll be. You're already different from your Avariel kin, and not just physically... ~
@14 = ~T-that's a cruel thing to say! I may not have my wings, but I'm still... still... ~
@15 = ~Maybe you're right. I am different now. But I didn't ask for it!~
@16 = ~Neither did I. It may surprise and dismay you to know I didn't change out of some greater purpose or realisation... I *liked* my previous life. It was easy... I could do as I wished... But now I have to get on with being what I am now.~
@17 = ~As we all do. Just concentrate on being you.~

@18 = ~Minsc, why are you... scratching at yourself like that?~
@19 = ~Oh, no, Fade, I am not scratching. Boo has chewed a little hole in my pocket, and even now he has escaped and is making a nest in my armour! At least, I hope he is making a nest... ~
@20 = ~Boo? Him? You have... something in there?~
@21 = ~Ahh, yes, Minsc and Boo, never to be separated... HA! I have you now Boo. Come here and meet my friend Fade.~
@22 = ~(whisper) You mean you haven't heard him constantly refer to him and Boo?~
@23 = ~(whisper) I just thought he was, you know, imagining things! I didn't actually think Boo existed... ~
@24 = ~See! Here he is!~
@25 = ~A RAT! You've got a bloody RAT in your pocket!~
@26 = ~No, Fade, Boo is a hamster! A miniature giant space hamster. And he is wise and fearless and counsels Minsc in times of trouble, and... ~
@27 = ~He's got a rat... a rat in his pocket... a RAT I tell you! (tries to bolt away)~
@28 = ~(Grab her as she bolts) No, Fade, it's OK, Boo is a hamster! Just look at him... he's not a rat... ~
@29 = ~(Let her go)~
@30 = ~(She looks over warily and shudders) Not a rat?~
@31 = ~(She runs away, obviously terrified)~
@32 = ~(smile) Not a rat. (put an arm around her shoulders)~
@33 = ~(laugh) Never thought you'd be scared of rats, Fade. But no, Boo isn't a rat. (try to put an arm around her shoulder)~
@34 = ~For the love of... what's wrong with you, woman? Boo's not a rat, difference being he's about half the size, he lacks the tail and he's a sodding hamster! Go on, look closer... ~
@35 = ~(shake head) Oh dear, I'd better go after her... maybe you should try to introduce her to Boo another time, Minsc.~
@36 = ~What in the Nine Hells was THAT all about? (sigh) Oh well, Minsc, maybe you should try to introduce the two of them at a later date... ~
@37 = ~See? See how small and furry his face is! Boo is no rat. Would you like to hold him? Maybe that would make you feel better... ~
@38 = ~But Boo is so small and furry... Fade! Do not be afraid! Boo will not hurt you, not unless I command him to--~
@39 = ~Well, all right, Boo, fair enough, not unless I ask you to, yes, I know, there is a big difference between being commanded and being asked... ~
@40 = ~Ummm, all right... not a rat... (she shrinks back slightly against your chest) Err, nice Boo. No, Minsc, you keep hold of him, I wouldn't want to drop him or anything... ~
@41 = ~(She shrugs off your arm indignantly) I'm not afraid of rats! I was just... taken by surprise, that's all.~
@42 = ~Nice Boo... good Boo. You stay with Minsc, like a good... rodent.~
@43 = ~Pardon? There's nothing wrong with me, <CHARNAME>, although I can't say the same for you if you continue to insult me so... (draws her weapon)~
@44 = ~Don't worry Minsc, I'm sure she'll come round. And I'd, uh, better go and see if she's OK.~
@45 = ~(Under your breath) Suuureee, Fade... Maybe it's time for you to put Boo away now, Minsc, for everyone's sake... ~
@46 = ~Fade! Calm down! I wasn't insulting you, I was just teasing you... put the sword down, and we'll say no more about the matter, okay?~
@47 = ~Pack it in, Fade. I don't take kindly to being threatened. Minsc, I'd put Boo away if I were you. Especially as some people can't take a joke... ~
@48 = ~(She relaxes as Boo is put away, but does not shrug off your arm)~
@49 = ~I heard that. (crosses her arms and stalks off)~
@50 = ~(She raises an eyebrow, and after a moment, sheathes her sword) All right, <CHARNAME>. (turns and leaves)~
@51 = ~(She grips her sword tightly) Pack it in? Can't take the joke? (she growls, her tail lashing)~
@52 = ~(Entwine a lock of her long crimson hair between your fingers) Are you all right now?~
@53 = ~Oh, for the love of... Fade! I didn't mean it like that! (go after her)~
@54 = ~Sensitive, isn't she, Minsc? Well, I suppose I'd better go after her... ~
@55 = ~(sigh) I'm not going to argue with you, Fade. Just stop it. Now.~
@56 = ~(She pulls away slightly) I'm fine, <CHARNAME>. (grin) But let me remind you, I'm not some kind of delicate flower who needs looking after, and I think I am perfectly capable of looking after myself.~
@57 = ~(She disentangles herself from you) And I don't take too kindly to being treated as if I can't. (winks and walks away)~
@58 = ~(She stops, but doesn't turn around, tapping her foot on the ground)~
@59 = ~Fine. If that's how you want it. (turns sharply and leaves)~
@60 = ~(Feeling a little confused, you watch her as she walks away. Has she just told you off, or was that some kind of invitation?)~
@61 = ~(After walking a short way from you, she stops, turns and blows you a kiss with a cheeky grin on her face.~
@62 = ~I'm sorry, Fade, I didn't mean to... ~
@63 = ~(You trail off under her silence. Then, to your great surprise, she turns around, and with a playful grin, kisses you on the cheek.)~
@64 = ~(whisper) So, who's the tease now? Two can play at that game, you know that... ~
@65 = ~(She winks, and with a decidedly mischievous grin, saunters off again.)~
@66 = ~(grin) Maybe it's time for you to put Boo away now, Minsc, for everyone's sake.~

@67 = ~Jan... those *things* on your head... can I ask what purpose they serve?~
@68 = ~Why yes! They are part of my Jansen AdventureWear (patent pending, of course!) collection. They enhance vision so that even the most minuscule of things become clearly visible! Useful things for people involved in our line of work, don't you think?~
@69 = ~Yes... but you mentioned a collection. You invent other things too?~
@70 = ~Oh indeed! And not just AdventureWear... I started with special devices for turnip preparation, just to make everyone's life that little bit easier. Imagine the possibilities! The Jansen Preparer... all those hours spent slaving over hot turnips, gone!~
@71 = ~Although many connoisseurs in the field may argue that the love would be taken away from turnip preparation by the device, I think it would mean people could devote more time to other pursuits, such as... oh, I don't know, art or turnip cultivation. It's just that Uncle Spanky always did enjoy taking his time with a good turnip... ~
@72 = ~Uncle... Spanky? Please don't tell me you're referring to another turnip preparing device... ~
@73 = ~(grin) Oh no, now you're thinking of the--~
@74 = ~Okay! I get the point. I really don't want to know.~
@75 = ~But the Turnip Extractor would revolutionise--~
@76 = ~Please! That's enough! I really, *really* don't want any more mental pictures about novel and exotic uses for turnips... ~
@77 = ~Novel and exotic uses? Turnips are a part of life, and so should be welcomed into all aspects of our day-to-day living. Why, Aunt Levidia swore that a once weekly bath in turnips did wonders for her complexion... I know! I'll dig out her recipe for Age-Defying, Skin-Enhancing Special Turnip Body Scrub!~
@78 = ~What?? Number one... are you saying I look old or something? And number two... why would I want to plaster mashed root vegetables all over my body?~
@79 = ~(Jan only grins and waggles his eyebrows)~
@80 = ~Ewww!~

@81 = ~Here, Fade, take this. Just a little present from a humble gnomish inventor.~
@82 = ~Err... a jar full of some... greenish... cream? What is this, Jan?~
@83 = ~I said I'd make you some of Aunt Levidia's Age-Defying Turnip Body Scrub... well, there you are. Recipe number 5, much sought after, I can tell you. Second Cousin Milos felt the back of Aunt Levidia's hand for trying to steal this recipe from her, and to say that she knocked him into next week would be an understatement.~
@84 = ~So how come you have it? If Aunt... Levidia... guarded the recipe so jealously... ~
@85 = ~There are ways and means, Fade, ways and means... ~
@86 = ~(grin) You're a gnome after my own heart, Jan. (sniff) The smell's rather... overpowering.~
@87 = ~Well, if you don't use it all, it doubles up as a delicious party dip. (sigh) Oh, Aunt Levidia's Anti-Aging No. 5... not for the youngsters, though. Eat too much and you won't be able to look at crudites in the same light again. Rather like Second Cousin Milos. He'd heard the rumours surrounding recipe's more... *rejuvenating* properties and decided he wanted it for himself. Terribly afflicted with boils, was Milos, and prone to hair loss too. He wanted to find a Djinni to grant him a wish, you see, but he knew a better deal when one came knocking!~
@88 = ~Aunt Levidia kept her store of No. 5 well-guarded and warded from prying eyes... never before has gnomish ingenuity involving things with spikes been employed with such ruthless efficiency!~
@89 = ~Did I mention that Milos suffered from boils? He smelt bad too... the stench was sometimes almost indescribable! It didn't seem to come from anywhere in particular... it just seemed to hang around him, emanating from every pore, insinuating itself into your sinuses until it was all you could smell... no word of it a lie. *Wolves* would run from Second Cousin Milos's stench. And his boils.~
@90 = ~With hindsight, though, his stench could have come from his belief in plastering his head with manure in the hope it would make his hair grow back. He preferred horse, but would go with anything at a pinch... ~
@91 = ~Err... yes... Thanks for the... scrub, Jan. Much appreciated... I think.~

@92 = ~I must admit, Fade, you are something of a puzzle to me. You are of obviously demonic heritage, and whilst you have an undeniable cruel and wanton edge, you also seem capable of great compassion. You veritably swirl with the chaos that seethes so obviously within you.~
@93 = ~Have you not considered trying to stabilise yourself a little... maybe find an anchor?~
@94 = ~Well, that was quite a compliment, Mazzy. Although by an "anchor", I believe you are referring to some kow-towing, experience-fearing religion of some kind... ~
@95 = ~What do you mean by that? I have found great solace in Arvoreen. He is a positive influence for me, and has enriched my life greatly! I just thought that you too might find your centre through a higher purpose.~
@96 = ~(snort) Find my centre? Enrich my life? My life is rich enough already, for good or ill. I don't need an imaginary friend perching on my shoulder telling me what I should and shouldn't do.~
@97 = ~Imaginary friend? But the gods exist! You know this... everyone knows this!~
@98 = ~Oh, I know they exist. What I meant is the *relationship* you allegedly have with the gods is imaginary. Without believers, they are weak. They therefore drain us of our strength. And I give my strength to no one... I need it for myself!~
@99 = ~Then I pity you, Fade, for your lack of spirituality.~
@100 = ~(shrug) It means I answer and rely on no one but myself... and I am more than happy for it to be this way.~
@101 = ~No one? Not even <CHARNAME>?~
@102 = ~I... don't know what you mean.~
@103 = ~(smile knowingly) As you would have it, Fade.~

@104 = ~So, Mazzy, you're some kind of god-bothering fighter then? What happened, got kicked out of the family business?~
@105 = ~Family business? What are you talking about?~
@106 = ~Well, thieving, of course. Everyone knows every halfling worth his or her salt makes a good sneak... ~
@107 = ~Thieving?! How dare you! No one in my family has ever stooped so low--~
@108 = ~(grin) Suuuure they haven't... ~
@109 = ~No, they haven't! And I would advise you to keep your filthy accusations and aspersions to yourself in future!~
@110 = ~Why do I get the feeling I've touched a rather raw nerve there, Maz... ~
@111 = ~This discussion is *over*.~

@112 = ~So then, elf, the blood o' demons runs through them pretty veins o' yours? Never thought squeakies would have it in 'em to embrace such practices... makes a refreshing change from huggin' trees, I suppose.~
@113 = ~I am a Fey'ri, dwarf, yes.~
@114 = ~I'm likin' the sound of that... and I'm likin' this, too... gives ye somethin' to, ye know, grab on to... ~
@115 = ~What are you-- Let go of my tail!~
@116 = ~Ouch! Har har, landed me a good sharp slap there, girlie! Aye, the fiendling squeakie's got fire in her belly! I be knowin' a good draught that'll be quenching those flames, lass. (grin)~
@117 = ~(growl) And so do I! It's called blood!~
@118 = ~Fire in her belly, I said! Ah, don't be gettin' yer knickers in a twist, lass. Letting go now, I am.~
@119 = ~(growl) I should gut you where you stand... I *will* make you pay for that!~
@120 = ~(grin) That a promise?~
@121 = ~You... you... (growl) You WILL pay.~

@122 = ~Hmmm. That paladin over there, he seems rather familiar... ~
@123 = ~Hold your tongue in this most holy of places, demoness. If it wasn't for <CHARNAME>, I wouldn't even let you set foot in here!~
@124 = ~There's no need to get so worked up. I was only innocently remarking that I recognized one of these so-called knights... ~
@125 = ~And I've just remembered where from! Does the Order do much business in the Docks District?~
@126 = ~The docks? The Order go wherever they are needed, and so I expect they might... if there was a good reason.~
@127 = ~(grin) Oh, there was a good reason all right. A couple of pretty blond half-elven twins with a broad outlook on life and virtue, if I remember correctly... ~
@128 = ~Harlot! How dare you sully this place with your disgusting accusations!~
@129 = ~I'm not *accusing* anyone, Anomen. It isn't an *accusation*. It's a fact!~
@130 = ~Shut up! No longer shall I listen to your forked tongue!~
@131 = ~(laugh) Poor, innocent Anomen, didn't even realize the Order got up--~
@132 = ~Be silent, foul succubus-spawn! I shall not allow you to disparage the Order in this way!~
@133 = ~Tut tut... temper, temper!~
@134 = ~I must say, <CHARNAME>, I cannot even begin to comprehend why you actually allow that... that *fiendling* to travel with us! She is incorrigible!~
@135 = ~Oh, I don't know, Anomen, she's quite fun to be around.~
@136 = ~I know what you mean, Anomen, but she's very useful and a skilled fighter... and I need all the help I can get if I want to get Imoen back.~
@137 = ~It's nothing to do with me, Anomen. Sort it out between yourselves!~
@138 = ~Why, thank you, <CHARNAME>. It's good to see that at least *someone* has a sense of humour around here.~
@139 = ~I understand, <CHARNAME>, but even so... (sigh)~

@140 = ~Sometimes you surprise me, bard. For all your doom and gloom, I see you looking about you with the wonder, dare I say, of a child given a new gift. Surely you are used to such small things on this plane by now.~
@141 = ~Ahhh, my magpie, everything I witness is a small miracle to this humble sparrow. Where chaos coalesces and forms such beauty... to know that everything is different from one second to the next, and that in one fateful second, all could crumble and fall into oblivion... ~
@142 = ~We walk upon the edge of a knife, and yet we walk it willingly, seemingly oblivious that if we stray but one step too far, we will fall from existence into nothingness, to decay, to be forgotten... ~
@143 = ~So I suppose the message is "seize the day", then?~
@144 = ~(grin) Yes, you could say that.~
@145 = ~Good advice.~
@146 = ~I've got some good advice too, you know, if you'd care to hear it... ~
@147 = ~Really? And that would be... ?~
@148 = ~(sweetly) "Get your hand off my backside".~

@149 = ~Would you look at the size of those bear prints, Valygar! I wouldn't like to come across a bear of that size.~
@150 = ~You wouldn't have anything to worry about if you left the bear alone. They only attack when threatened or disturbed.~
@151 = ~Or you could do that special animal command thing... ~
@152 = ~(sigh) Fade, I would never *command* an animal to do anything.~
@153 = ~(grin) But haven't you got... animal charms, Valygar?~
@154 = ~Well, that--~
@155 = ~(sigh) Whatever, Fade. Whatever.~

//LT2
@156 = ~May I ask a personal question of you, <CHARNAME>?~
@157 = ~Yes, of course. What do you want to know?~
@158 = ~Maybe later. Now is not such a good time.~
@159 = ~No, you may not. I do not wish to discuss such things with a near-stranger.~
@160 = ~Yes, what *is* it?~
@161 = ~I know that your main goal is to rescue your friend, Imoen. What exactly makes her worth so much effort?~
@162 = ~She's the closest thing I have to a sister, and she's my best friend. We grew up together in Candlekeep, and have been through more together than most people can imagine. I can't *not* rescue her.~
@163 = ~Oh, Imoen. She isn't much to me--we simply grew up together. But I will not suffer anyone to be imprisoned on a lie, and for that reason I must rescue her, as honour dictates.~
@164 = ~I did not realise you wanted to discuss Imoen, Fade, and I must admit I have no interest in talking about our relationship. It is enough that I wish to find her.~
@165 = ~I understand. I only wanted to ask you about Imoen, that's all.~
@166 = ~Oh, is that all? Of course. Ask away.~
@167 = ~I don't think I want to talk about this.~
@168 = ~Can't you take a hint? Go away.~
@169 = ~I see. I shall not disturb you further, then.~
@170 = ~No, wait, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude or short with you. It's just that all of this... ~
@171 = ~Good.~
@172 = ~Since you put it that way... nothing important, I'm sure. I will not disturb you further.~
@173 = ~Her capture must be... very hard for you. I can see now why you'd expend so much energy finding her. You... do know where she is, right? What it will take to get her back?~
@174 = ~Yes... and it will continue to get harder. She has been taken to wherever the Cowled Wizards keep their prisoners, along with the mage Irenicus. The Cowled Wizards deemed her a magical deviant, so they just... took her. I can't allow this--we grew up together, and she has stuck by me through everything. I can't abandon her now.~
@175 = ~What do you think? Of course it's hard! We grew up together, fought together, laughed together, cried together... and now she's been taken from me! Damn Irenicus, and damn the Cowled Wizards, and this stupid city's rules about magic! How were we to know? We didn't even know where we were?~
@176 = ~Hard? Hardly. I owe Irenicus a debt of pain. Getting Imoen back... well, I suppose that's just a sort of added bonus. Of the insufferably cheerful kind.~
@177 = ~We may have grown up as siblings, but that doesn't necessarily mean I have to like her. It's Irenicus I'm after. I owe that mage big time.~
@178 = ~I can understand that sentiment, <CHARNAME>, but sometimes it does help to talk about these things.~
@179 = ~No, it doesn't. So stop snooping.~
@180 = ~Yes, I suppose you're right. What do you want to know about her? She's basically the closest thing I have to a sister. We grew up together in Candlekeep, and have been through much together. I cannot bear to think of her being imprisoned. She is innocent, a victim of circumstance--and I know she would do the same for me if our roles were reversed.~
@181 = ~Honour? Is that all you care for? I would have thought the imprisonment of your friend would mean more to you.~
@182 = ~If you do not have honour, what else do you have? It matters not to me who it is, whether a friend or a stranger.~
@183 = ~Honour is important to me, Fade. Of course I care something for Imoen... we did grow up together. But my honour dictates it doesn't matter who it is. I would still be bound to rescue them.~
@184 = ~(She gives you a rather stern, measured look, but then inclines her head) I suppose I understand. It is about "all of this"... about Imoen... that I wish to ask you about.~
@185 = ~You wanted to ask about Imoen? What do you want to know about her? She's basically the closest thing I have to a sister. We grew up together in Candlekeep, and have been through much together. I cannot bear to think of her being imprisoned. She is innocent, a victim of circumstance--and I know she would do the same for me if our roles were reversed.~
@186 = ~Well, I'm not interested in discussing Imoen with you, Fade. I just want to find her, okay?~
@187 = ~You wanted to ask about Imoen? She isn't much to me--we simply grew up together. But I will not suffer anyone to be imprisoned on a lie, and for that reason I must rescue her, as honour dictates.~
@188 = ~No, you can't. A terrible injustice has been done to both you and Imoen and it must be rectified. And I'm glad to help you recover her... I cannot stand to hear of one incarcerated so wrongly.~
@189 = ~Well, I'm glad you're here too. I have the feeling I'm going to need all the help I can muster.~
@190 = ~Thank you... but what's your deal with this whole incarceration business anyway?~
@191 = ~So I take it you weren't in the vicinity of Athkatla when you were capture by Irenicus?~
@192 = ~No. We were just outside of Baldur's Gate, actually. I think I know why he may be interested in me, but Imoen... I have no idea why he would have wanted her. Damn him! Why make her suffer so?~
@193 = ~No, we weren't. We just defended ourselves against a threat... and due to that, Imoen is gone. I can only blame myself. If I had only stood up to those damn wizards then... ~
@194 = ~Insufferable? How can you say that about one you have shared so much with?~
@195 = ~Fade, I was joking. Okay, maybe it wasn't in the best possible taste, but it's something Imoen would have appreciated. Come on, I really don't want to talk about this anymore.~
@196 = ~You haven't met Imoen. That's all I can say on the matter. All I can think about now is punishing Irenicus for what he has done to me.~
@197 = ~There's more to life than just revenge, <CHARNAME>. I know this personally. Please do not lose yourself to it.~
@198 = ~(A small smile, almost reassuring, reaches her lips, and with that she takes up her place again in the marching order)~
@199 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm afraid I have little time for this sort of honour. My friends and loved ones come first, no matter what. I would have hoped you would feel the same.~
@200 = ~(She gives you a slightly withering look and takes up her place once more in the marching order)~
@201 = ~I suppose I can understand that... although I would not have put it in such a way. My friends and loved ones always come first.~
@202 = ~(She gives you a small smile and then returns to her place in the marching order)~
@203 = ~I have a problem with... wrongful incarceration. I cannot help it. But I... do not wish to discuss such things yet, <CHARNAME>. Sorry.~
@204 = ~(She inclines her head to you and then returns to her place in the marching order)~
@205 = ~Because, sometimes, that is what they want. It hurts just as much to see someone you love suffer. Sometimes even more.~
@206 = ~(She offers you a wan smile) Come on, <CHARNAME>... let's go then, and make Irenicus pay for all he has done to you and your sister.~
@207 = ~And if you had, you'd probably be dead by now. And they would still have Imoen. There's no point in playing the "if only" game, <CHARNAME>. What has happened, has happened, and you're doing all you can to rectify it. Imoen couldn't ask for anything more.~
@208 = ~(She offers you a wan smile) Come on. Let's go and make Irenicus pay for the pain he has caused you and your sister.~

//LT4
@209 = ~<CHARNAME>. May I ask you a question?~
@210 = ~Of course, Fade. What is it?~
@211 = ~No. You're not here to ask questions, and I'm not here to answer them. Fall back into line.~
@212 = ~It's just that... I have heard much of your previous exploits in Baldur's Gate. How you averted a war and everything. Is it... all true?~
@213 = ~Yes. All of it is true. I also solved the problem of the iron shortage, stopped major bandit activity in the area... everything.~
@214 = ~Well, I don't know exactly what you've heard, but yes, I did avert a war... but I couldn't have done it without the help of my companions. They deserve as much of an accolade as I do.~
@215 = ~What? If you've heard of what happened, why are you asking me? Yes, I did everything they say I did. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to get back to more important things than answering stupid questions.~
@216 = ~Well, depending on what you've heard... it's all true. It wasn't easy though. Many people forget how many of my loved ones and companions died during that time. It's not all glory.~
@217 = ~(She raises an eyebrow and grins) *All* of it is true? Even the story where you're 17 feet tall and skewered 10 men at once with one thrust of your mighty lance?~
@218 = ~Okay, I know when I'm being teased. If it's believable, then I probably did it.~
@219 = ~My previous exploits are not to be belittled, Fade. I do not care for your sarcasm.~
@220 = ~Really? People have said that? Wow!~
@221 = ~(smile) Yes, things are made so much easier when you have loyal... friends... around you. Still, your accomplishments are quite... heroic, if you don't mind me saying so.~
@222 = ~Oh, I don't know about heroic. Things had to be done. I couldn't just stand there and let everything fall down around my ears. So much was at stake... ~
@223 = ~I don't mind at all! Like I said, I had help, but it's still my name that people remember, huh?~
@224 = ~Thank you for the compliment, but the way you said "friends"... it's as if you haven't had much of a chance to use the word before.~
@225 = ~I see. I was going to congratulate you on your accomplishments, but I see your head is already swollen enough. I am sorry to have... bothered you with such trivial matters.~
@226 = ~Yes, I have to agree with you. People tend to forget the great cost one has to pay when undertaking such tasks... all that is remembered is the glory.~
@227 = ~(She lays a hand on your arm) I am sorry for your loss.~
@228 = ~That's all right. Although I sometimes feel their loss acutely, life must go on. Sitting and brooding about the dead doesn't bring them back, nor does it do their memory any favours.~
@229 = ~(snatch your hand away) I do not wish to discuss my former companions with you, Fade. You are here to assist me, not probe my inner psyche. Do not bother me with such trivial matters again.~
@230 = ~(cover her hand with yours) We all love and lose, Fade. And unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about it, no matter who we are.~
@231 = ~(grin) I'm sorry... I couldn't resist! Still, even after picking through some of the more... fantastic versions of your exploits, they are still quite extraordinary.~
@232 = ~But then again, I suppose you couldn't be anything less, if rumours about your apparent heritage are to be believed... ~
@233 = ~And what do these rumours say?~
@234 = ~And just what do you mean by that? What have you heard?~
@235 = ~I suppose you're right. Being a child of Bhaal certainly makes life a bit more interesting.~
@236 = ~I was not belittling you, <CHARNAME>. I was only trying to bring a little levity to the conversation. I am actually quite impressed by your previous deeds... but not by your attitude.~
@237 = ~Then perhaps you should shut up and fall back into line? I do not tolerate such commentary from my lackeys.~
@238 = ~Please forgive my defensive stance, Fade. It's just... let's just say people aren't always so complimentary.~
@239 = ~(laugh) Yes, people have said that, and more! They also speak of your... apparent heritage.~
@240 = ~And what do they say?~
@241 = ~What do you mean by that? What have you heard?~
@242 = ~Oh, there's nothing apparent about it--I'm a child of Bhaal. You needn't beat around the bush about it.~
@243 = ~There's no need to be bashful, <CHARNAME>. You have much to be proud of. You have achieved so much--people respect you, even though they know of your... apparent heritage.~
@244 = ~Apparent heritage? What do you mean?~
@245 = ~And why should people not respect me? I am a child of Bhaal. I cannot help it.~
@246 = ~Was that a compliment or an insult, Fade? I know people sometimes find the fact that I'm a child of Bhaal hard to swallow, but it's their problem, not mine. Does it bother you?~
@247 = ~I do not care for your tone, Fade. What does my heritage have to do with this?~
@248 = ~Yes... although much of that is probably due to the rumours surrounding your heritage, don't you think? What would you pick, a lowly ranger or cleric? Or the child of the dead Lord of Murder?~
@249 = ~I suppose you're right. How did you know I'm a child of Bhaal?~
@250 = ~What do you mean by that? What have you heard?~
@251 = ~I... I... ~
@252 = ~(sigh) No, <CHARNAME>, I have not had much cause to use that word in conjunction with myself. Although I hope that will change.~
@253 = ~It already has. How do you feel about being a friend of a child of Bhaal?~
@254 = ~Well, don't get your hopes up too high. Come on, we'd better catch up with the others.~
@255 = ~I can only agree with you there, <CHARNAME>. Many would say that such sentiments would be incomprehensible to one of your apparent heritage, but I am glad they are wrong.~
@256 = ~Apparent heritage? What do you mean?~
@257 = ~And why would they say that? I may be a child of Bhaal, but that doesn't mean I don't have feelings.~
@258 = ~I'm glad you can see that... and that my being a child of Bhaal doesn't bother you.~
@259 = ~(She seems to stare at your hand for a while, as if she is unsure of how to react. You then feel her fingers tighten slightly on your arm)~
@260 = ~I... I can only agree with you there, <CHARNAME>. Many would say that such sentiments would be incomprehensible to one of your apparent heritage, but I am glad they are wrong.~
@261 = ~That... that you are a child of Bhaal, the dead Lord of Murder. Is it true?~
@262 = ~Yes, it's true. Does it bother you?~
@263 = ~Ahh, so we get back to that, do we? Well, I'm not prepared to discuss it with you, Fade. Not now, not ever. Understand?~
@264 = ~Yes, it's true, but I don't like to discuss it. Can you just leave it? Please?~
@265 = ~So you... admit your heritage? I was quite worried about mentioning it, in case you... in case... ~
@266 = ~In case I denied it and got angry? Don't worry, Fade. Unless of course it bothers you.~
@267 = ~Well, now you have confirmation, can we just drop it? Please?~
@268 = ~Yes, I can understand your reaction. Your apparent heritage cannot be an easy thing to deal with sometimes.~
@269 = ~No, it doesn't. I feel honoured to travel with you, to be part of your adventure.~
@270 = ~And I'm glad to have you with me.~
@271 = ~Well, so you should. Now we really must get on.~
@272 = ~I... I feel honoured to travel with you, to be a part of your adventure. And I feel even more honoured now you consider me a friend.~
@273 = ~I'm glad to have you with me. And the honour is all mine.~
@274 = ~I don't say that at all. Others might, but not me. I feel honoured to travel with you, to be a part of your adventure.~
@275 = ~(smile) All right, all right. I won't press the issue if you don't want me to. For now, anyway.~
@276 = ~Fair enough. I only wished to discuss your past, but I suppose it can wait.~
@277 = ~Hang on... what do you mean? What have you heard?~
@278 = ~You're right. It can wait. I do not wish to discuss my past with you, Fade. Ever.~
@279 = ~I only wished to ask you about your past... but I can see you are above such trivial matters.~
@280 = ~You're right, I am above such trivial matters. I do not wish to discuss my past with you, Fade. Ever.~
@281 = ~If that's the way you like it, fine. You won't hear from me on the subject ever again.~
@282 = ~Yes, I suppose we'd better, at that. Let's go.~
@283 = ~That's... very good to hear, <CHARNAME>. Thank you.~
@284 = ~Can you ask me later? Now is not really a good time.~
@285 = ~Rumours, mainly. So... it's true, then?~

//LT6
@286 = ~<CHARNAME>, is there something you want to ask me? I've seen you giving me puzzled looks a lot recently--what is on your mind?~
@287 = ~It's nothing really, Fade. Don't worry about it.~
@288 = ~Actually, I just... well, I don't want to be rude, but... why *do* you have a tail? If that isn't too personal a question, of course.~
@289 = ~Nothing to worry about. It's simply that you aren't quite like other elves I've met before.~
@290 = ~(laugh) I'll make up my own mind what worries me and what doesn't! I would rather you told me what it was, though.~
@291 = ~Okay then. It's just that... well, you have a tail. Obviously I noticed it as soon as we met, but... ~
@292 = ~Like I said, it's nothing really. It's just that you're not quite like any other elf I've ever met before.~
@293 = ~I wondered when you would ask me that, <CHARNAME>... and no, I don't mind at all. I'm from a race of elves known as the Fey'ri.~
@294 = ~The what? I've never heard of the Fey'ri before.~
@295 = ~Aren't they the elven equivalent of tieflings? Doesn't that mean you have a demonic ancestor?~
@296 = ~The Fey'ri? You're a demonic elf? I've heard of your people, but I never thought I'd actually meet one.~
@297 = ~That's because I'm not like other elves. I'm a Fey'ri. Do you... know what a Fey'ri is?~
@298 = ~No, I've never heard of them.~
@299 = ~I'm not quite sure... aren't they like the elven equivalent of tieflings? You know, people who have a demonic ancestor?~
@300 = ~Yes, of course I do. The Fey'ri are elves with demonic blood. I never thought I'd meet one, thought.~
@301 = ~(smile) And you didn't know how to approach me about it? Many people say that. I have a tail because I am a Fey'ri. Do you know what a Fey'ri is?~
@302 = ~No, I don't.~
@303 = ~Aren't they a bit like tieflings? But elves instead of humans? You mean you have a demonic ancestor?~
@304 = ~Yes, actually, I have heard of your people. I did wonder... I never actually thought I'd ever meet one.~
@305 = ~The Fey'ri are a race of Sun elves who have... Tan'ari ancestors. We hail from the Hellgate in the High Forest to the north.~
@306 = ~My grandfather is a Cambion... a half-demon. Does this bother you?~
@307 = ~Yes, a little. It didn't even cross my mind that you might be part Tan'ari. Doesn't that mean your people are evil?~
@308 = ~No. Should it?~
@309 = ~I judge people by their actions, Fade, not by their heritage. Considering what I am, it seems only logical.~
@310 = ~Yes, it does! If I had known, I would never have allowed one of such evil heritage into my party!~
@311 = ~Yes, we are like tieflings. We share a demonic heritage, although we do not hail from the Planes. We come from the Hellgate, north of here, in the High Forest.~
@312 = ~No, not at all. Should it?~
@313 = ~Well, yes. A little bit. I did wonder if this was the case... but I have heard that your people are savage and evil. Is this true?~
@314 = ~Why should it? I judge people by their actions, Fade. I myself have an unusual heritage, as you know. It would be rather presumptuous of me to judge others in a way I would not want to be judged.~
@315 = ~Yes, of course it does! I had my suspicions all along... and now they have been confirmed! I should never have allowed you to join up with me.~
@316 = ~You have heard of us? That's a bit surprising... there aren't many of us around. How did you find out about us?~
@317 = ~I grew up in the fortress of Candlekeep. They have a huge library... the whole Hellgate Saga is chronicled there. So I know all about your people.~
@318 = ~I have an... interest in such things.~
@319 = ~Depends what you mean by evil. Yes, they are cruel and savage, and many people would consider them evil, but that's just their way. They honestly don't know any different.~
@320 = ~And you think that excuses them?~
@321 = ~But obviously you do. What makes you so different from them?~
@322 = ~Really? You surprise me, <CHARNAME>. Many people get quite... upset when I tell them what I am. They think my heritage makes me a demon too.~
@323 = ~Well, apart from a bit of temper and a blatant disregard for the concept known as "other people's possessions", you don't seem too demonic to me, Fade.~
@324 = ~It can happen. Some people have difficulty seeing beyond what you are, and seem incapable of seeing *who* you are. I have had the same problem in the past. It is why I do not judge you now.~
@325 = ~Oh, sod other people, Fade. You know what you are, and that's all that matters.~
@326 = ~I can see many advantages to that, Fade. I'm sure if you let people think you're a demon, they would do as you wished. And that can't be a bad thing.~
@327 = ~I am... most thankful for that, <CHARNAME>. It is good to meet someone who knows what it is like to be judged on their heritage alone... you know how it feels. I'm glad it does not bother you.~
@328 = ~Your heritage may not bother me, but please don't think this means I have dismissed all my misgivings over you. I will not judge you... yet. I still do not entirely trust you.~
@329 = ~Good. And I'm glad that you've been honest with me.~
@330 = ~Well, I'm glad we've got that out of the way. Now we can continue our pursuit of Irenicus.~
@331 = ~I'm sorry you feel that way, <CHARNAME>. I suppose I should have... expected such a response.~
@332 = ~But I cannot help it. This is the way I was made. (sigh) I suppose I should gather my things... I will be gone as soon as I can.~
@333 = ~Good! And good riddance!~
@334 = ~No, Fade, I didn't mean it like that--I overreacted. It's just a bit of a shock, finding out one of your companions is part demon. Please forgive my hasty words.~
@335 = ~No, stay here. I still need your help. Just... stay away from me.~
@336 = ~And so, does that... bother you? Considering all you know about us?~
@337 = ~I'm not sure... maybe a little bit. Are they all as evil as the chronicles say?~
@338 = ~Yes, to be honest, it does. I know what Fey'ri are, and I suspected all along you were one. I should never have allowed you to join up with me.~
@339 = ~An interest? Such interests can be bad for you, <CHARNAME>. The Abyss and its denizens are best left alone. Believe me.~
@340 = ~Why? Simply because they are viewed by the majority as evil? Are they truly as evil as people deem them?~
@341 = ~I suppose you would know. Have you had many dealings with the Abyss?~
@342 = ~I'm not about to take advice from you, Fade. My interest has never brought me to harm.~
@343 = ~I didn't say that. Even if they did know any different, I doubt they would change. Too much of their behaviour is bred into them.~
@344 = ~But you're not like that, are you? What makes you different?~
@345 = ~But you seem different. Apart from a bit of temper and a blatant disregard for the concept known as "other people's possessions", you don't seem too demonic to me.~
@346 = ~I... I've experienced things other Fey'ri have not. It's given me a unique view of the world. I don't consider myself different from my kin, it's just... ~
@347 = ~You've discovered compassion and empathy. You said you wanted to help me, and you've offered yourself to my cause. That's not the kind of behaviour I'd normally expect from one of your kind.~
@348 = ~What kind of things? What have you experienced?~
@349 = ~You say that about my people? And then what? Wipe out the drow? Then the orc hordes? The Frost Giants? How long before *you* then become the "evil" one, feared by all? That kind of thinking soon snowballs, <CHARNAME>.~
@350 = ~So what would you suggest? Live and let live? Let the evildoers prey on the weak and innocent forever more? No, we must take action!~
@351 = ~I suppose there is some wisdom in those words. How long does it take before the freedom fighters become the oppressors? It's not easy, is it? What would you suggest?~
@352 = ~(laugh) I know when I'm being teased, <CHARNAME>! But I suppose there's a grain of truth to that. I am not "the norm" amongst my kin. I... I've experienced things other Fey'ri have not. It's left me with a different view of the world. Truthfully, I don't consider myself any better or worse than my kin, it's just that... ~
@353 = ~(laugh) Thank you for that! And you are absolutely correct! I know who I am, who cares what other people think?~
@354 = ~Sometimes I worry that I won't be accepted... but whether you meant that or not, I have never heard a truer word spoken in jest.~
@355 = ~I didn't mean it that way, <CHARNAME>! For me, that's a disadvantage, not an advantage. I don't want people to do as I want because they fear me, I just want to make my own way in life.~
@356 = ~(She turns away, obviously slightly disturbed by your inference)~
@357 = ~I suppose I can understand that. We haven't travelled together for long. I suppose I hoped you had overcome your misgivings, but then again... it's early days yet.~
@358 = ~(She gives you a lingering, almost pleading look before turning away)~
@359 = ~I see no reason not to be honest with you, especially about this. I could hardly lie to you, anyway... the tail and the red eyes are a bit of a giveaway, wouldn't you say?~
@360 = ~Besides, what chance do I have of you ever trusting me if I'm not honest with you about something as fundamental as my ancestry? Because I *do* want you to trust me.~
@361 = ~(She stops tightening the straps on her backpack and looks at you. After a while, she gives you a slightly hurt smile)~
@362 = ~Fair enough. I forgive you. Just please remember in future: do not judge other lest ye be judged yourself.~
@363 = ~You think to insult me, then demand I stay? Well, you are sadly mistaken!~
@364 = ~Not many... but enough to last me this lifetime. The Tan'ari normally come to us for... whatever reason. I don't really like talking about it. Let's just say its name barely does it justice.~
@365 = ~But that's part of your heritage, why fear it like that? What makes you so different from other Fey'ri?~
@366 = ~You haven't come to any harm *yet*. All it takes is for one of the Demon Lords to realise a Bhaalspawn has taken an interest in them, and then... I think the phrase commonly used is "a snowball's chance in Hell". Because that's what you'd have.~
@367 = ~Not that I'd know... about the snowball in Hell. I haven't been there. But if you do insist on continuing this... interest, well... just be careful.~
@368 = ~I do not need you to tell me how to conduct my interests, so butt out.~
@369 = ~I suppose I never thought about it like that before. Thank you for your concern. I will be careful.~
@370 = ~You're far too kind to me, <CHARNAME>, but I am far from this picture you've painted of me. I just know I have to help. If this is compassion, well... ~
@371 = ~(She smiles at you and unexpectedly gives you a quick hug) Thank you.~
@372 = ~Thank me? For what?~
@373 = ~I... I can't say. Not yet.~
@374 = ~I'm just not ready. I know you have misgivings about me being here, but I must also know I can trust you first. I'm sorry.~
@375 = ~And what do you think people will say when they hear that a child of Bhaal, the Lord of Murder, has gone on a killing spree--even if it is against so-called "evildoers"? Talk sense, <CHARNAME>.~
@376 = ~How dare you speak to me in such a manner, Fade? I do not know why I even deign to speak to one such as you.~
@377 = ~I suppose I can see your point. It wouldn't be as easy as all that. So what would you suggest?~
@378 = ~No, it wouldn't be easy. And if I knew the answer... well, I certainly wouldn't be a lackey of the Shadow Thieves, still!~
@379 = ~I suppose we just have to go along our own paths, doing things as we see fit. It's all anyone can ask. Come on, all this thinking is giving me a headache.~
@380 = ~For giving me a chance. You have no idea how much I appreciate that.~
@381 = ~Yes, we should get going.~
@382 = ~I'm sorry it has come to this, <CHARNAME>. But if ever you decide you need my help again, I will be at my guildhouse.~ 
@383 = ~I was only showing a little friendly concern, but since it's obviously not to your taste... very well, I shall refrain from making that mistake ever again.~
@384 = ~I certainly hope you will, <CHARNAME>. I've... got used to your company, and I'd hate to have to wake up someday and find you a little heap of ash, or worse.~
@385 = ~Oh, so the conversation of one "such as me" isn't good enough for our resident <PRO_LORDLADY) of Murder? Very well, I'll make sure your divine ears aren't bothered with it again, ever!~
@386 = ~It still doesn't excuse them. They should be wiped from the face of Faerun.~

//LT8
@387 = ~May I speak with you?~
@388 = ~Yes, of course. What is on your mind?~
@389 = ~Not right now.~
@390 = ~Again? You're really beginning to wear on my nerves, you know.~
@391 = ~I am just intrigued. We have spoken much of your…unusual heritage, and I just wonder how that affected you as you were growing up. Were you reviled or revered, I wonder?~
@392 = ~Actually, my childhood was very pleasant. I knew nothing of my heritage, and those who did know treated me no differently from the other children. I still had to attend my classes, do my chores... and I had my fair share of clips round the ear for misbehaving, as well!~
@393 = ~Neither. I didn't actually know anything of my heritage as a child. I only found out about it relatively recently, so it was never an issue.~
@394 = ~My childhood was nothing special. I hardly think about it, to be honest. I didn't know anything about my heritage--hardly anyone did. Gorion made sure of that.~
@395 = ~Why the hell are you asking me such inane questions, Fade? If you're bored, go pester someone else.~
@396 = ~Fair enough. I only wanted to ask you a little about yourself. I thought *that* particular topic might engage you for a while, at least.~
@397 = ~Fade, there's no need for that. I didn't intend to be rude. What do you want to know?~
@398 = ~And just what do you mean by that?~
@399 = ~I'm not saying I don't want to talk to you, Fade, just that now possibly isn't the best of times. Surely you can see that--why are you so offended?~
@400 = ~I see. I see that one as self-important as you obviously has no time for one as lowly as me.~
@401 = ~Self-important? Me? You dare accuse me of that after prattling on about yourself the last few times I've spoken to you? Come on, Fade, it's obvious there's only one person here you want to talk about--yourself.~
@402 = ~You've got it.~
@403 = ~But doesn't that annoy or anger you? You may have lived this idyllic childhood, or your perception of an idyllic childhood... but they lied to you about who you are, about what you are. Do you not think that they watched you from the shadows, waiting for Bhaal's blood to manifest in you? What would they have done then?~
@404 = ~They would not have tolerated that, I am sure. You would have been led like a lamb to the slaughter, only for acting on impulses that are bred in you. Wouldn't you have preferred to have known?~
@405 = ~What do you mean by all that? I'm glad they *didn't* tell me... I led a normal life, as any child has the right to. And as for these impulses you're alluding to, they weren't there. Maybe if I had been told about my heritage, they would have been stirred up, and things might have happened. But they weren't. Gorion saved me once--he would have done it again, if necessary, of that I'm sure.~
@406 = ~Of course I would have preferred to have known. It annoys me that they didn't tell me. If they had told me of my heritage earlier on, I would have had time to learn how to deal with my enemies, rather than being plunged into it as I was. I realise Gorion was only trying to shield me, but... well, he left me when I needed him most.~
@407 = ~Fade, I'm not sure I like you talking about the people I love in such a way. The people of Candlekeep treated me as one of their own, especially the ones who knew about my heritage. Can you imagine how I would have been treated if it had been common knowledge? I would have been feared--no parent would have allowed their child to go near me, let alone be my friend. It would have been a very lonely existence for me, that's for sure. Being surrounded by friends and loved ones probably prevented any darker impulses from surfacing in the first place.~
@408 = ~They didn't lie to me, Fade. They just... withheld a bit of information for my own good. Nothing positive would have come from telling me, nor from making my heritage common knowledge--in fact, more damage would probably have been caused that way. When Sarevok found out about me, he killed Gorion and came after me. Luckily I was of an age to defend myself. Imagine what would have happened if I had only been a child.~
@409 = ~You never knew? Why did they not tell you? One of such a... powerful heritage would surely have been seen as an asset to your community. You could have demanded anything of them, and they would have complied.~
@410 = ~An asset? Are you joking? I would have been a target, nothing more. There would be no laughter, no friends in my childhood had that been the case. Everyone would have pointed, saying "There goes the child of the Lord of Murder... do not anger <PRO_HIMHER> lest you become one of <PRO_HISHER> victims." Everything from a bad harvest to chicken killings would have been laid at my door. No, I am more than happy that Gorion kept it to himself.~
@411 = ~Do you think I haven't considered that already? I could have had power. Or I could have been killed in my sleep by fearful villagers. But it's in the past now. I wasn't told, and I am what I am because of this. Would you have preferred it any other way? I wouldn't. Things happen for a reason, be they good or bad.~
@412 = ~I never thought of it that way before... but you're right. They had no right to hide my heritage from me. Just think what I could be by now.~
@413 = ~But who was he really to keep something so important from you? Don't you think he could at least have been honest about you about your birth? What did he really think to gain from hiding all this from you, I wonder. There must have been something... ~
@414 = ~What do you mean? He loved me, as a father loves his child. He had nothing to gain from fostering me--in fact he had more to lose. This would have been doubly true if people knew about my heritage. Thankfully they did not.~
@415 = ~Fade, why must you see conspiracy in everything? I am not entirely sure I like your implication. Gorion raised me as his own... that is enough for me. As for the decisions he made, well, I seem to have turned out all right. I have no complaints.~
@416 = ~I have often wondered that myself. Maybe he thought he could control me later, as an adult. I don't know. And I suppose I never will, now that he is dead.~
@417 = ~Inane? Pester? I do not know why I even wanted to talk to you in the first place!~
@418 = ~Okay, I'm sorry. I suppose I did overreact there... I shouldn't have said that. It is just that I am intrigued. We have spoken much of your... unusual heritage, and I just wonder how that affected you as you were growing up. Were you reviled or revered, I wonder?~
@419 = ~I only wanted to ask you something, and yet you do not even have time for a simple question! You talk to complete strangers more than you talk to me!~
@420 = ~Why are you bothered by this, Fade?~
@421 = ~Of course I do! That is because complete strangers don't fly off the handle unexpectedly, and they don't expect to be the complete focus of my attention all the time! Fade, I don't know what you were expecting from me, but as you said yourself, you're just here to help. Nothing more.~
@422 = ~I'm not offended, <CHARNAME>, not as such. I should never have said that. I don't even know why I did. I have a bit of a temper sometimes, and I do say things I don't really mean. I'm sorry.~
@423 = ~I just wanted to ask you something that has intrigued me for a while. We have spoken much of your... unusual heritage, and I just wonder how that affected you as you were growing up. Were you reviled or revered, I wonder?~
@424 = ~It's okay, Fade. Actually, my childhood was very pleasant. I knew nothing of my heritage, and those who did know treated me no differently from the other children. I still had to attend my classes, do my chores…and I had my fair share of clips round the ear for misbehaving as well!~
@425 = ~Well, as long as you're sure you didn't mean it... My childhood was nothing special. I hardly think about it, to be honest. I didn't know anything of my heritage--hardly anyone did. Gorion made sure of that.~
@426 = ~And you wonder why I didn't want to talk to you in the first place? Why the hell are you asking me such inane questions, Fade? If you're bored, go pester someone else.~
@427 = ~Well, that's where you're wrong! I was actually going to ask you a question about you!~
@428 = ~Me? What do you want to know about me?~
@429 = ~Well, there's a turnup for the books, thief. But I don't feel like sharing information about myself with you, okay? Now just leave me alone.~
@430 = ~You respected Gorion a lot, didn't you?~
@431 = ~It was more than respect, Fade. He was my father. Maybe not by blood, but I loved him as much as any child can love their father. It still hurts that he is not here to guide me. There are times when I wish... ~
@432 = ~Yes, I suppose I did. He taught me much. But there is no point dwelling on the past like this, Fade. Things happen for a reason, be they good or bad.~
@433 = ~I'm sorry, Fade, but I do not wish to discuss Gorion at the moment. Even after all this time, it still hurts me to do so. As for the other aspects of my childhood, I cannot complain. I look back on my childhood fondly... And what of you? How does a Fey'ri upbringing compare to mine?~
@434 = ~So you feel bitter towards Gorion, then? For not telling you?~
@435 = ~No, not bitterness. I just can't stop thinking that perhaps, if he had told me, I could have prepared for what happened. I couldn't defend Gorion. I wanted to, but even then, I just thought myself as plain old <CHARNAME>, nothing special about me. If I had known, if I had had the time to prepare, I could have defended him, and he would still be alive now.~
@436 = ~Of course I do. If he had told me, I could have protected him. But he didn't, so I couldn't, and he died. He left me when I needed him most.~
@437 = ~I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sully your loved ones. I just... find it hard to believe that they didn't encourage you. The Fey'ri would have revelled in your heritage. You would have been revered, and your impulses encouraged.~
@438 = ~Did you ever... do you ever... feel the need to... well, destroy things? Destroy... and kill? Just for the pleasure of it all?~
@439 = ~I don't think I want to answer that, Fade.~
@440 = ~Of course not! Why? Have you?~
@441 = ~Sometimes, when I think someone really deserves it. Take Irenicus for example. I could quite happily kill him. I know that everyone has it in them to want to hurt those who have hurt them in some way, but sometimes the intensity of my feelings... well, it scares me.~
@442 = ~What are you suggesting, Fade? An orgy of death and bloodshed? I knew you would have it in you. You can take a demon out of the abyss, but you can't take the abyss out of a demon, so to speak... ~
@443 = ~It would have been slaughter. As inexperienced as you were, you were at least an adult when it happened. A child wouldn't have stood a chance. Yes, I understand that, <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry to have brought all this up.~
@444 = ~No need to apologise, Fade. You have every right to be curious... as do I. What about your upbringing? How does a Fey'ri upbringing compare to mine?~
@445 = ~It's okay. It happened, and nothing can change that. I don't blame you for being curious. So what of you then? What of your childhood?~
@446 = ~Yes, well, you've certainly managed to stir up a lot of unwanted feelings today. Maybe you should leave me alone for a bit.~
@447 = ~I suppose you are correct. I must admit, it is not the way I would have seen it.~
@448 = ~You would have been told of your heritage from the start, if you were Fey'ri. One of such blood would have definitely been seen as an asset, although that would not have protected you from an assassin's blade. It must have been hard for Gorion to keep such a huge secret from you.~
@449 = ~I don't know how hard it was for him. Obviously we never discussed it. I found out after his death, via a letter he wrote to me. I miss him, you know. When I was a child, I used to wish he wasn't there, so I could play all the time and never have lessons or chores again. I realise now just how much he cared for me. I never got to tell him that.~
@450 = ~Yes, I hate to think how much he worried about me, whether he wondered if I would just snap one day. But still, through all that, he continued to be my father.~
@451 = ~I agree. Still, he could have told me. Maybe not as a small child, but as I got older. Then maybe there would have been something I could have done, rather than him just... leaving me like this.~
@452 = ~(sigh) I wish I could have the courage of your convictions, but I for one cannot hand over the reins of my life to Fate.~
@453 = ~Well, what of you? I've told you about my childhood--what about yours?~
@454 = ~I see. Well, we all have to live our lives our own way, I suppose. I just hope that one day you find that courage.~
@455 = ~You could have been many things, I suppose. Dead is one of them. If you were Fey'ri... well, they would have revelled in your heritage--you would have been revered, and your impulses encouraged.~
@456 = ~Bothered? I'm not bothered. I just wanted to ask you a little about yourself... to satiate my own curiosity, if you will.~
@457 = ~We have spoken much of your... unusual heritage, and I just wonder how that affected you as you were growing up. Were you reviled or revered?~
@458 = ~Fine. Then we have nothing to talk about.~
@459 = ~Ahhh, so we're interested now, are we? I just wanted to ask you about your childhood, that's all. How you coped with being one of the Children. But if you don't want to... ~
@460 = ~Okay, Fade, I apologise for being short with you. Actually, my childhood was very pleasant. I knew nothing of my heritage, and those who did know treated me no differently from the other children. I still had to attend my classes, do my chores... and I had my fair share of clips round the ear for misbehaving as well!~
@461 = ~Fair enough, I think you've made your point. I'm sorry. But my childhood? It was nothing special. I hardly think about it, to be honest. I didn't know anything of my heritage; hardly anyone did. Gorion made sure of that.~
@462 = ~After all that, you just want to ask me inane questions?! If you're bored, go pester someone else.~
@463 = ~Since you put it that way... gladly!~
@464 = ~You wish... what?~
@465 = ~I wish... it had been me instead of him. I am the direct cause of his death. I try not to dwell on it too much, but... well, you know. I just wish there was something more I could have done.~
@466 = ~Nothing. I'm sorry, Fade, but I do not wish to discuss Gorion at the moment. Even after all this time, it still hurts me to do so. As for the other aspects of my childhood, I cannot complain. I look back on my childhood fondly... And what of you? How does a Fey'ri upbringing compare to mine?~
@467 = ~I... my upbringing would have been very different from yours, <CHARNAME>. Very different indeed.~
@468 = ~(She takes a deep breath, and then looks around, as if she is trying to avoid your gaze. When she realises that you are not about to leave it there, she shakes her head and smiles)~
@469 = ~Please, let us leave it there. I know it may seem unfair after all I have asked you, but even with Gorion's death, you had a pleasant childhood. I didn't. I just hope you understand that.~
@470 = ~I understand. I'm sorry.~
@471 = ~I can sympathise with that, believe me. One day... well, one day I'll tell you all about it. My upbringing was... very different from yours. I just... can't tell you now.~
@472 = ~He didn't abandon you, <CHARNAME>, and you didn't abandon him. As much as I hate to admit this... sometimes, these things happen. And there's nothing you can do about it.~
@473 = ~I wish there was, but there isn't. You shouldn't feel bitter--you should feel proud that he was willing to lay his life down for you.~
@474 = ~That's cold comfort, Fade. But as you said, these things happen. Come on. We've got things to do.~
@475 = ~I suppose you're right... but you speak as if from experience. Did something similar happen to you? What of your upbringing?~
@476 = ~One minute you think he was wrong for not telling me, and the next you are defending him? Make up your mind already!~
@477 = ~I can understand that, <CHARNAME>. However, if you ever do have these feelings, you can always talk to me. One day... well, one day I'll tell you all about it. My upbringing was... very different from yours. I just... can't tell you now.~
@478 = ~Sometimes. My upbringing was very different from yours, <CHARNAME>. The Fey'ri have a different set of values. One day... well, one day I'll tell you all about it. I just... can't tell you now. I know this may seem a little unfair after everything you have told me, but please, try to understand.~
@479 = ~There's nothing to be scared of. Your feelings towards Irenicus are natural, I'm sure. He has hurt you a great deal, and we shall make him pay.~
@480 = ~If I am honest, and I want to be honest with you, I sometimes feel the same way. But then my upbringing was very different from yours. One day... well, one day I'll tell you all about it.~
@481 = ~And just what do you mean by that? I... I don't want to go there again, be that again... ~
@482 = ~I... don't want to talk about this with you anymore, <CHARNAME>. Please, excuse me.~
@483 = ~I was only trying to see things from all perspectives, <CHARNAME>, nothing more. I can see that you were hurt deeply by what has happened, and I'm sorry for bringing it up.~
@484 = ~No need to apologise, Fade. I shouldn't have blown up like that. You have every right to be curious... as do I. What about your upbringing? How does a Fey'ri upbringing compare to mine?~
@485 = ~It's okay. I shouldn't have flown off the handle like that. I don't blame you for being curious. So, what of you then? What of your childhood?~
@486 = ~Yes, I have. I'll make sure you're no longer troubled by my prattling, oh-so-gracious <PRO_LORDLADY> of Murder.~
@487 = ~Perhaps, <CHARNAME>. We'll see.~
@488 = ~Yes, we should get moving.~

//LT10
@489 = ~<CHARNAME>, I cannot help but feel that I brushed you off rather quickly the last time we spoke. It is only natural for you to want to know about my upbringing, especially since I asked you about yours.~
@490 = ~(smile) So, what do you want to know?~
@491 = ~Actually, Fade, my interest on that subject has waned. I really couldn't care less whether you told me or not.~
@492 = ~Well... everything, really. I can't even imagine what the childhood of a part-demon would be like.~
@493 = ~Oh. Really. Fair enough, then. The truth would probably be too much for your tiny mind anyway.~
@494 = ~(She turns away, and flicks her tail rather insolently at you)~
@495 = ~Well, truth be known, I did not have a "childhood" as you would understand it. There were no toys, no games... only competition, violence and chaos. Fey'ri children are encouraged to revel in their basest of instincts in preparation for adulthood. There is so much inter-sibling rivalry that many do not reach maturity.~
@496 = ~That sounds horrible!~
@497 = ~What about you, though? Do you have any siblings?~
@498 = ~Sounds a bit like drow society to me.~
@499 = ~Only if you know differently. Only now do I realise the extent of the brutality my kin are capable of. Killing for advancement within your family hierarchy is accepted. Killing for the sheer pleasure of it... well, that is almost applauded.~
@500 = ~So what of your family? Do you have any siblings?~
@501 = ~That kind of reminds me of the tales told of drow society.~
@502 = ~I'm truly sorry you had to go through that, Fade.~
@503 = ~I have some. I had many. Many of us have different fathers. My eldest brother was my mother's pride and joy--he is a cambion, a half-demon, and very powerful. Luckily, being nearly 200 years younger than him, I was barely a threat to him. He left us to join the Blood Wars when I was no more than a babe.~
@504 = ~As far as I know, I have one full blood brother, two living half-sisters and three living half-brothers, including Freth. There were more.~
@505 = ~More? You mean they killed each other?~
@506 = ~So you have one full brother? Tell me about him.~
@507 = ~That many siblings? I didn't realise the Fey'ri were so fecund.~
@508 = ~You wouldn't be the first to make that comparison. However, Fey'ri society is far more chaotic than even the drow.~
@509 = ~Even there, if you are caught in the act of murder, you have to stand a judgement of sorts. Among the Fey'ri, however... one of my half-brothers was caught during the brutal murder of one of my half-sisters. Nothing was done... he had simply eliminated his rival. Such is the way of demons... and of their elven by-blows.~
@510 = ~That is dreadful. I'm so sorry, Fade. Please, tell me of your siblings.~
@511 = ~It's a wonder you're not insane! How did you come through all of this?~
@512 = ~Sorry? Why should you be sorry? None of us knew any differently. You see, the Fey'ri are as brutal to each other as they are to outsiders. One of my half-brothers was actually caught during the brutal murder of one of my half-sisters... he had simply eliminated his rival. Such is the way of demons... and of their elven by-blows.~
@513 = ~Yes. The Fey'ri see everything as a matter of gain. If you stand in the way of what they want, you are a rival who must therefore be eliminated. Whether you are family or not does not come into it. The only time we stand as one is when the whole house is threatened... and even then, it is a tenuous thing.~
@514 = ~I can see why you didn't want to discuss this with me at first. Hearing of my happy childhood must have been a wrench for you.~
@515 = ~Didn't you fear for your life then?~
@516 = ~So what about your blood-brother? Tell me of him.~
@517 = ~So... did you kill any of your siblings? Considering how it seems the norm amongst your people... ~
@518 = ~Xek'ral is my womb-brother... my twin. (sigh) We hated one another... always vying for my mother's attention. Not that she had much use for either of us.~
@519 = ~He left us to train as a soldier--I do not know whether he is now a member of the Dlardrageth house guard or serving in the Blood Wars. I know it sounds awful, but I couldn't care less.~
@520 = ~I suppose you couldn't wait to get away from it all.~
@521 = ~That's awful. Didn't you fear for your life?~
@522 = ~Oh yes they are. They have to be to sustain our numbers. With literally half the family being slaughtered by the other half, I'm surprised we end up with any siblings left at all. Although, on that logic, I would now be dead... ~
@523 = ~But you aren't. Didn't you ever fear for your life?~
@524 = ~Did you ever... kill any of your siblings? Considering it's the done thing... ~
@525 = ~Like I have said, at the time I knew no different. It's what I went through afterwards that made me realise everything at the Hellgate is so wrong... But that's another tale for another time.~
@526 = ~Is there anything else you want to know, or have I thoroughly disgusted you enough?~
@527 = ~You don't disgust me, Fade. I'm sorry these things happened to you, that you had to go through that, but you're here now. Please try not to dwell on it. You have nothing to be ashamed of. Come on, let's talk of other, happier things. Do you know any good riddles?~
@528 = ~No. Please... continue. What happened to you to make you realise things were so wrong with your people?~
@529 = ~Well, I would like to say "not really"... but yes, it is. I hear of you and Imoen... of your escapades, of how much your father loved you... I can't even imagine how it would feel to have a loving parent. All we were ever taught was to fight, and win--whatever the cost.~
@530 = ~Whatever the cost? Did you ever... kill any of your siblings then?~
@531 = ~Did you ever fear for your life then?~
@532 = ~Not really. We were prepared to expect assassination attempts from an early age, but as a younger daughter, my only real role in life would have been that of a breeder or soldier anyway.~
@533 = ~A... breeder? You would have been expected to breed with demons then?~
@534 = ~Yes. One of my older half-sisters. I thought she was favoured. At the time I felt so proud, so... *justified* when I sank my knife into her throat, and sliced the wings from her back. Normally it is younger siblings being murdered by their older counterpart. For a younger daughter to kill her elder was seen as something to be proud of.~
@535 = ~That's monstrous, Fade! How could you do such a thing? I... I really cannot believe you murdered your own sister... ~
@536 = ~Thank you again, <CHARNAME>, for not judging me. Please forgive me, but I am not in the mood for riddles at the moment. I have not had cause to think about my family in some time. I... I think I need some time to myself for a bit.~
@537 = ~I... I cannot. Again I must ask you to be patient with me. I am sorry. I... I think I need some time to myself for a bit.~
@538 = ~Yes. The Fey'ri consider those with more demon blood in them stronger. Therefore if your mate is a cambion, or even better, a true Tan'ari, the blood of your offspring is stronger, and that can only benefit your house.~
@539 = ~Please... let us speak of other things now. I really don't want to think about it.~
@540 = ~I am a monster. I know.~
@541 = ~No, that's not what I meant. What you did was monstrous... but like you said yourself, you knew no different. I'm really sorry I brought this up. I was only curious, Fade. I didn't mean to upset you.~
@542 = ~I... I don't know what to think, Fade. Do you regret what you did?~
@543 = ~It's not your fault. I haven't thought of my sister in years. I... I think I need some time to myself for a bit.~
@544 = ~I... I don't know. She was a murdering bitch in her own right. I suppose I regret *why* I did it. It wasn't for any other reason than for gain on my part.~
@545 = ~I haven't thought of my sister in years. I... I think I need some time to myself for a bit.~

//LT16
@546 = ~(As you settle down to rest, Fade removes her cloak and you realise that marring one of her shoulders is what seems to be a nasty burn)~
@547 = ~Ouch, Fade. Where did you get that burn?~
@548 = ~How did you get that... mark, Fade? If you don't mind me asking.~
@549 = ~(As soon as she realises you have noticed the strange mark, she contrives to cover it up, looking slightly worried) Burn? It's not a burn.~
@550 = ~Looks like a burn to me. What is it, then?~
@551 = ~No? So... what is it? If you don't mind me asking.~
@552 = ~(She gives you a measured look, but then sighs and shrugs) It's a... brand.~
@553 = ~A brand? Like on cattle? How did you get one of those?~
@554 = ~A brand? I... see. How long were you a slave, then?~
@555 = ~Why would someone want to brand you? Did you do something wrong?~
@556 = ~(sigh) No, I don't mind. I suppose you have... the right to know.~
@557 = ~It's okay. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.~
@558 = ~Of course I have the right to know. If there's something going on, I need to know how it might affect all of us.~
@559 = ~I have the right to know what, Fade?~
@560 = ~(She turns on you, her eyes flashing angrily) Cattle? Cattle?? I was a slave, okay? A slave! (she whirls round and storms off)~
@561 = ~(catch her by the arm) A slave? When? Where? How?~
@562 = ~(go after her and catch her lightly by the arm) Fade! I didn't realise! I really didn't realise... ~
@563 = ~A slave? You? You're kidding... right?~
@564 = ~(She looks at her feet, and starts to draw a pattern in the dust with a toe) About five years, at a guess. You can't really keep track of time much. I was sold to a Pasha in Calimshan.~
@565 = ~That's awful! But at least you are safe now... aren't you?~
@566 = ~Five years? What kind of slave were you?~
@567 = ~Five years? How did you escape?~
@568 = ~So what have you been doing ever since? Just running around Athkatla?~
@569 = ~And if I did? As it happens, I was a slave, okay?~
@570 = ~A slave? I thought you might have been in prison or something, but a slave... That's even worse!~
@571 = ~A slave? I... see. How did it happen? How did you escape?~
@572 = ~A slave? When? Where? How?~
@573 = ~A slave? I... see. What kind of slave were you?~
@574 = ~So, does this mean your... owners... will be after you?~
@575 = ~(She turns to you, sighs and sits down heavily, hugging her knees) I know. It's not the kind of thing that one shouts about. I was captured and sold to a Pasha in Calimshan.~
@576 = ~I... see. How did it happen? How did you escape?~
@577 = ~I... see. What kind of slave were you?~
@578 = ~A slave? Does this mean your... owners... will be after you?~
@579 = ~I wish I was, <CHARNAME>. But unfortunately, that is not the case. I was captured and sold to a Pasha in Calimshan.~
@580 = ~So, what about your previous... owners? Does this mean they will be after you?~
@581 = ~How did I escape? It's not important, really. The fact that I did is all you need to worry about at the moment, <CHARNAME>.~
@582 = ~I... will tell you, but just not now. I hope you understand.~
@583 = ~Of course I understand, Fade. Tell me when you are ready. Can I ask one other thing, though?~
@584 = ~I'll decide what I worry about, Fade. I can't believe you've kept this from me, and are now withholding more. For all I know, you might still have people after you. I want the details, and I want them now.~
@585 = ~Why does everyone do this to me? They start to tell me something, and then when I ask for details... I'm fed up of it! So you can keep your little secret for all I care--I'm not interested!~
@586 = ~(As soon as she realises you have noticed the strange mark, she contrives to cover it up, looking slightly worried, but then sighs and shrugs) No, I don't mind. I suppose you have the... right to know.~
@587 = ~(She shakes her head) You'll probably find out anyway, and I'd rather tell you myself. It's a brand. I... I was a slave, <CHARNAME>.~
@588 = ~(A flash of anger crosses her eyes) It's a brand, okay? I got it when I was bought. Nothing that will affect you in any way.~
@589 = ~Bought? What do you mean, bought? Were you a slave or something?~
@590 = ~Bought... ? Oh, I understand. I'm sorry. I didn't mean... ~
@591 = ~Bought? What were you, a slave or something? I wouldn't have thought you would have put up with that.~
@592 = ~Bought? Hmmm... so that's your deal with slavery then.~
@593 = ~(sigh) You have the right to... to know about my past. This... this is a brand. I got it when... when I was a slave.~
@594 = ~How did it happen? It's not important, really. And the fact that I escaped is all you need to worry about at the moment, <CHARNAME>.~
@595 = ~(She manages a wry smile) Is it that much of a surprise to you? It happened years ago. I was... captured, and sold to a Pasha in Calimshan.~
@596 = ~That's awful! But at least you are safe now... aren't you?~
@597 = ~Calimshan? What kind of slave were you there?~
@598 = ~You were captured? How did that happen? And how did you escape?~
@599 = ~I was bought as an exotic oddity. For years I fought in the gladiator pits, and worked in the harem.~
@600 = ~(She gives you a look that is both acutely fragile and fiercely proud) Does this bother you?~
@601 = ~Well, the gladiator pit bit doesn't, but the harem... ?~
@602 = ~Well, I know that many slaves have to work the harem, but killing people as a spectacle... ?~
@603 = ~No, it doesn't bother me. You did what you had to. I'm just grateful you're here now.~
@604 = ~Yes, it does! So you were a whore and a murderer... How can you live with yourself?~
@605 = ~I don't know. It's been quite some time now, and if they are after me, I've never heard anything. I... do keep a low profile, just in case. You... you don't think they would still... after all this time... ~
@606 = ~No, that's insane. It's been so long... they probably think I'm dead or something.~
@607 = ~I don't know, Fade. I mean, they must have paid good money for you. If it was me, I'd want to get you back.~
@608 = ~You're probably right. There's no way they would still be after you after all this time. What were you to them, anyway?~
@609 = ~I'm sorry, Fade, but I really don't want to have to find out you're wrong. You're handy in a fight and all, but I can't risk having you in the party. I must ask you to leave.~
@610 = ~I was a slave. Bought in Calimshan, by a Pasha. For years I fought in the gladiator pits, and worked in the harem.~
@611 = ~It's all right, <CHARNAME>. It happened years ago. I was... captured, and sold to a Pasha in Calimshan.~
@612 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, I was a slave. Bought in Calimshan, by a Pasha. For years I fought in the gladiator pits, and worked in the harem. And it wasn't like I had any choice.~
@613 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, that's my "deal" with slavery. I was bought in Calimshan, by a Pasha. For years I fought in the gladiator pits, and worked in the harem. And it wasn't like I had any choice.~
@614 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>.~
@615 = ~What kind of slave were you?~
@616 = ~What have you been doing since you escaped? Just running around Athkatla?~
@617 = ~What about your... former owners? Won't they be looking for you?~
@618 = ~Well you're not going to get them! I'm... not ready to tell you. Sorry. Good night.~
@619 = ~I don't know. I hope so. It's been quite some time now, and if they are after me, I've never heard anything. I... do keep a low profile, just in case. You... you don't think they would still... after all this time... ~
@620 = ~Surviving. In any way possible.~
@621 = ~But then I met you. Life has definitely taken a... turn for the better. (sigh) Let's not talk of such things anymore. Let us eat, and rest, and... oh, I don't know, tell silly stories or something.~
@622 = ~I know. I have to live with the fact that I was... that I was... a whore. I had no choice. It didn't matter if I protested. Some of them... preferred it that way, anyway. I... really don't want to talk about it.~
@623 = ~I can... understand that, Fade. So what have you been doing since? Just running around Athkatla?~
@624 = ~I... had no idea. If you ever do need anyone to talk to... ~
@625 = ~Oh, Fade... .(give her a hug)~
@626 = ~Just how many men have you had to... entertain, Fade?~
@627 = ~I know. I have to live with the fact that I was... that I was... a murderer. I had no choice. It was either kill, or be killed. Sometimes with weapons, sometimes with my bare hands. I really don't want to talk about it.~
@628 = ~Just how many people have you killed, Fade?~
@629 = ~Thank you, <charname>. It means a lot to hear you say that. Life has definitely taken a... turn for the better since I met you. (sigh) Let's not talk of such things anymore. Let us eat, and rest, and... oh, I don't know, tell silly stories or something.~
@630 = ~I live to the best of my capabilities! It's not like I had a choice, you know. I take it you've never been tortured for hours on end, or flogged until your back bleeds? Or been held down by two men, while another... ~
@631 = ~I'm not prepared to discuss this with you at the moment, <CHARNAME>. And I need... a little time to myself.~
@632 = ~"If you were them?" But you're right. It worries me, too. I just hope I was so insignificant that... I just don't matter to them anymore. But maybe that's just wishful thinking.~
@633 = ~I'm sorry, Fade. You're handy in a fight and all... but with all of this... I can't risk having you in the party. I must ask you to leave.~
@634 = ~Well, at least I know now, and can prepare, just in case the worst does happen. But I need some rest now, and so do you. We can discuss this further later.~
@635 = ~Enough. I don't see why it should bother you. It doesn't... directly affect you.~
@636 = ~I... I need to rest, <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry. We can discuss this another day.~
@637 = ~I... I see, <CHARNAME>. I won't trouble you any longer with my presence, then.~
@638 = ~(She gives you a final hurt, confused look, and melts away into the shadows)~
@639 = ~(smile) I know who to go to. I know. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. (sigh) Let's not talk of such things anymore. Let us eat, and rest, and... oh, I don't know, tell silly stories or something.~
@640 = ~(At first she almost tries to fight your embrace, but then as she relaxes, she returns it, burying her face into your shoulder. You cannot help but notice the almost spicy scent of her hair, and the way she curls her fingers around the back of your neck. After a while, and almost reluctantly it seems, she breaks away from you)~
@641 = ~Thank you. I... I needed that. (smile) But let us not talk of such things anymore. Let's eat, and rest, and... oh, I don't know, tell silly stories or something.~
@642 = ~Fine, <CHARNAME>! I'll just keep to myself from now on!~
@643 = ~Yes... later. Sleep well then, <CHARNAME>.~

@644 = ~(sigh) Again I see you staring gawk-eyed at <CHARNAME>, Fade. Please, close your mouth and take yourself elsewhere, lest I be washed away by your ill-disguised desires.~
@645 = ~I am rapidly growing weary of your barbed and foul mouth, drow. Your constant jealousy leaves a bitter miasma, tainting everything it touches.~
@646 = ~Jealousy? Hardly. What is there to be jealous of? I just find it hard to concentrate around such simpering. Surely you are a disgrace to your heritage, jalil. Are you hoping that <CHARNAME> will deign to indulge in your... animalistic charms?~
@647 = ~(Fade's tail begins to lash) Animalistic?~
@648 = ~Why, yes, fiendling. Animals have tails, and any pairing with you would surely have to be considered an act of bestiality by--~
@649 = ~You tread on dangerous ground there, darkling. I should hold your poisoned tongue, before I cut it out.~
@650 = ~Hah! Do not threaten your betters, iblith! The drow summon and command your demonic counterparts as slaves, and we would do the same to your mongrel kind if you were worth the bother.~
@651 = ~Again, I warn you, Viconia... ~
@652 = ~Warn me of what? Your... base thuggery against the strength of my goddess-given magic? Shar stands with me, fiendling, and together we shall teach you your place in this world!~
@653 = ~Oh yes, your goddess. And you have the nerve to speak to me of slavery? I forget that the drow are nothing without some half-cut, half-insane deity in tow to bolster themselves. You speak constantly of the strength of the drow, but it is an external thing, granted to you, not from within, in the blood, like the Fey'ri!~
@654 = ~I should strike you where you stand for that blasphemy, iblith!~
@655 = ~So why don't you? Come on, Viconia. You forever speak of your strength, of your cruelty, but I have yet to see either in any measurable quantity. Strike me if you dare? Or are you afraid of your own insignificance, that your... goddess... won't measure up?~
@656 = ~Let me say it in your filthy tongue, so you know *exactly* what I mean:  Jous uns'aa t'yin, kl'eril uss--jous uns'aa vel'bol dos ph' morfel del! Show me then, useless one--show me what you are made of!~
@657 = ~Losing control of that fiery temper, fiendling? Let me stoke that pathetic wrath of yours further! (She begins to move her hands and chant, obviously invoking her goddess to cast a spell)~
@658 = ~(Fade sees Viconia casting, and with a guttural growl, charges her. She cannons into Viconia, knocking the slighter drow to the floor, disrupting her spell. The drow tries to wrestle herself free from the slightly heavier Fey'ri, but instead earns herself a stinging back-hand across the face from the wildly enraged part-demoness)~
@659 = ~Let me go! You shall pay! I shall stove your head in! I shall turn your bones to lead! I shall... ~
@660 = ~Shut up, Vil'khroch bitch!~
@661 = ~(She grins fiercely as Viconia complies, though the drow priestess looks like she's about to set Fade on fire with just her wrathful gaze) So, the 'supreme ruler' has fallen! It looks as though your goddess has failed you after all!~
@662 = ~(Before Fade can do any more damage to Viconia, and before Viconia can take advantage of the Fey'ri's gloating to do her harm, you employ the most basic of prevention tactics: grab them both by the ear)~
@663 = ~Ahhh! What's this for?~
@664 = ~Unhand me, male!~
@665 = ~(Both women, however, don't struggle too hard. It's amazing how much control a person has over you when they've got you by the ear)~
@666 = ~All right, ladies. Break it up. As arousing as a catfight is, I need both of you in one piece.~
@667 = ~Fade, what the hell do you think you're doing? Viconia was obviously baiting you. I thought you'd know better than to play into her hands.~
@668 = ~Viconia, why do you insist on harassing Fade?~
@669 = ~Hmmph. She started it. I don't understand why you drag the useless drow bitch around with us.~
@670 = ~Speak for yourself, fiendling. It's not as though you contribute anything to this party but your whoring, slithering body for all to look at.~
@671 = ~Enough! Fade, if I ever see you touch Viconia again, I swear I'll... I don't know, but it will be unpleasant!~
@672 = ~Shut up! Viconia, leave Fade alone! She is *not* a whore, and you are *not* going to antagonize her anymore. Do you understand?~
@673 = ~Both of you, leave each other alone, unless you invite me from the get go, or at least let me watch, and there's some kind of edible treat involved. Do you get me?~
@674 = ~(Fade narrows her eyes) Fine. (She plucks your fingers from her ear) And I don't want *you* touching *me.* I think we're both perfectly clear on this.~
@675 = ~You... you side with this... this... nuij? Bah! (She slaps your hand away from her) Go be the animals you both are. You disgust me.~
@676 = ~Hah! You and your male mind. (She laughs, and pushes your hand from her ear) I'll be taking a bath. The sweat from that drow has made me feel rather unclean.~
@677 = ~This is not over yet, Fade. Do not think it is. (She detaches you from her ear as well.) But for <CHARNAME>'s sake, I will wait. When the time is right... ~
@678 = ~Whatever. (She blows a kiss at Viconia) I'll see you when it's treat time!~

//LT12
@679 = ~(Fade walks up beside you and smiles, holding out her hands to you) You will notice that there is nothing in my hands, nor concealed upon my arms.~
@680 = ~Eh? What are you talking about?~
@681 = ~(sigh) Fade, don't be tiresome. What are you doing?~
@682 = ~Going to perform a trick of some kind, then? These are always amusing.~
@683 = ~(grin) Oh, come on, <CHARNAME>. Just play along, if only for a moment.~
@684 = ~(She holds her hands out again to you. They are small and deceptively delicate, the fingernails sharp and slightly curved, no doubt another feature of her Tan'ari heritage) Nothing in my hands, right? And nothing concealed up my sleeves.~
@685 = ~Okay... no, there's nothing in your hands, and I can't see anything being concealed in your sleeves.~
@686 = ~Fade, I'm not in the mood for silly tricks. Go and show someone who will appreciate it more.~
@687 = ~Well, I *was* going to show you a trick, but now if you're going to be mean, I'm not going to.~
@688 = ~Good.~
@689 = ~Go on then, show me your trick.~
@690 = ~(laugh) It isn't supposed to be amusing, it's supposed to be astounding!~
@691 = ~(Fade winks at you and within a blink of an eye snaps her fingers and seems to produce a small flower from thin air. The normal build up of energy that surrounds a magical casting is absent--you know that this was simply a sleight of hand trick)~
@692 = ~(She holds the flower up for you to look at--it is perfect. You have no idea how she concealed it so well without crushing it)~
@693 = ~(take the flower from her and examine it) How did you do that? It's not even bruised.~
@694 = ~(applaud her) Well done!~
@695 = ~Hmph. Simple sleight of hand--seen it a thousand times before.~
@696 = ~(sniff) Fine. I'll do that then.~
@697 = ~(She grins broadly and taps the side of her nose) A trickster *never* reveals her secrets to a layperson! Do you want to see another one?~
@698 = ~Yes please!~
@699 = ~No, this one is quite enough. I have to ask though--why the flower? Why not a coin?~
@700 = ~(She bows low to you and, grinning rather impishly at you, tucks the flower behind your ear) Do you want to see another one?~
@701 = ~Oh. I thought it might amuse you. Oh well.~
@702 = ~Okay then.~
@703 = ~(She turns away from you, obviously preparing her next trick. After a short moment she turns back to you) This time, notice this gold coin.~
@704 = ~(She holds it up for your inspection, and then throws her hands up in the air. As she snaps her fingers, the gold coin disappears. With a grin, she shows you her hands--they are empty)~
@705 = ~And now to make it reappear... ~
@706 = ~(She leans forward, takes your earlobe in between her thumb and forefinger, and rubs lightly. From this, the gold coin appears again. With a smile, she draws it out and holds it in front of your face for your inspection. She then raises an eyebrow and gives you a rather pointed look) Perfect in every way... wouldn't you agree, <CHARNAME>?~
@707 = ~Are you talking about the gold or my ear?~
@708 = ~Yes... now hand me back my coin!~
@709 = ~I... err... Well, it was the easiest thing to hand, I just saw it there and thought... you know. You can... keep it, if you like.~
@710 = ~(Her cheeks colour slightly, and she hurries back to scouting for you)~
@711 = ~Well... you choose.~
@712 = ~(chuckle) You don't miss a trick, do you?~
@713 = ~(She hands you back your coin and makes her way back to scouting for you)~
@714 = ~Hmph. Some people just don't appreciate a good thing when they're about to see it.~

@715 = ~Edwin! Here's one for you... how many Red Wizards does it take to change a candle?~
@716 = ~None. We have servants like you to do it for us.~

@717 = ~Piss off, Korgan! You touch me one more time, and I'm going to gut you!~
@718 = ~(grin) Aye? And then?~
@719 = ~And then I'll slit your throat... ~
@720 = ~Ohh, lassie... ye talks dirty fer a squeakie... ~
@721 = ~And then... and then I'll plait ribbons in your beard. Pink ones, for preference.~
@722 = ~Ach, no! Ye had to go and spoil it, din't ye, y'stupid wench!~
@723 = ~And then I might paint flowers on your armour... nice roses, or maybe petunias. What do you think?~
@724 = ~Ye're a sicko, ye know that? Nothin' more than a no good squeakie after all.~
@725 = ~(grin) Awww... ickle Korgan doesn't like flowers and ribbons. (She strokes his beard and then unconsciously wipes her hand down the front of her britches)~
@726 = ~(wink) Ye're an evil wench, Fade--a right down n' dirty wumman. If ye could only be growin' a beard now... ~

//LT18
@727 = ~(As you walk along, you turn to regard Fade. Now you know why she wanted to help you recover Imoen, but you still wonder exactly how she became a Shadow Thief in the first place. She notices your thoughtful gaze and smiles at you) Are you okay, <CHARNAME>? Do you want to ask me something?~
@728 = ~No, no. It's okay.~
@729 = ~Well, there is one thing, actually. Now you've told me about your... past, I just wondered how you became a Shadow Thief.~
@730 = ~It's nothing really. I suppose I am just wondering what ever possessed you to join the Shadow Thieves, that's all.~
@731 = ~Are you entirely sure? You know you can ask me anything.~
@732 = ~Anything? Ummm... okay. What's the capital of Sembia?~
@733 = ~Well, I don't want to pry, but I did just wonder how you became a Shadow Thief.~
@734 = ~I just wondered what ever possessed you to join the Shadow thieves. Like I said, it's nothing *that* important.~
@735 = ~Well, I can't tell you the details. We *are* a kind of secret organization... ~
@736 = ~Secret? Hardly! Everyone knows who the Shadow Thieves are.~
@737 = ~No, you misunderstand me. I'm not interested in how other people become Shadow Thieves--I want to know how *you* became one. Whatever possessed you to join?~
@738 = ~Nothing "possessed" me. I was just... offered membership.~
@739 = ~So they just took one look at you and said, "Hey, stranger! Would you like to join our club", then?~
@740 = ~I see. I take it that the... offer was too good to refuse, then?~
@741 = ~You were just offered membership? Why on earth did you say yes?~
@742 = ~<CHARNAME>, I was being serious! What do you want to know?~
@743 = ~Yes, everyone knows of us. But what do we *actually* get up to? Who are our members? Can you actually name any other Shadow Master, apart from Aran? I bet you didn't even know who Aran Linvail was until Gaelan told you.~
@744 = ~(chuckle) Okay, you win. You're right. The Shadow Thieves are either the worst kept or the best kept secret in the world. Everyone knows they exist, but no one knows much about them.~
@745 = ~(laugh) True! You seem to know Aran quite well, though. What's he like?~
@746 = ~Hmph. You act as if that's something to be proud of.~
@747 = ~(chuckle) Of course not! It is... quite hard to become a full member of the Shadow Thieves. (sigh) You know I lived on the streets for a while? Well, I got caught thieving on Renal Bloodscalp's patch. He was NOT impressed with what I was doing... but he was impressed by how I was doing it. It seemed like even on my own, I was cutting into their profits.~
@748 = ~They locked me up for a while, but just as I thought I was going to remain locked up for good, another man came to see me. And, to my surprise, he offered me a position. It was nothing fancy--just permission to carry on with what I was already doing, as long as I gave everything to the Guild. In return, I would be fed, clothed, paid and have a place to call home.~
@749 = ~For someone scratching a living on the streets... well, it sounded a good deal.~
@750 = ~You don't sound so convinced now.~
@751 = ~So they locked you up and gave you an ultimatum, then?~
@752 = ~(shrug) Kind of. You know I lived on the streets for a while? Well, I got caught thieving on Renal Bloodscalp's patch. He was NOT impressed with what I was doing... but he was impressed by how I was doing it. It seemed like even on my own, I was cutting into their profits.~
@753 = ~They caught me thieving on their patch. I didn't have much of a choice, really. They were NOT impressed by what I was doing, but they were impressed by how I was doing it... It seemed like even on my own, I was cutting into their profits.~
@754 = ~(grin) Exactly.~
@755 = ~So why did you join, then? Was the offer to good to refuse?~
@756 = ~My Shadow Master? He is... fair. Please excuse me, but I do not really have the authority to speak about him.~
@757 = ~What do you mean, "authority"? I only asked what he was like.~
@758 = ~I see. So why did you join them then? Was the offer too good to refuse?~
@759 = ~What do you mean by that? The Shadow Thieves do much for Athkatla... ~
@760 = ~Exactly *how* do the Shadow Thieves contribute to Athkatla? Apart from keeping the crime rate up and the City Guard in jobs?~
@761 = ~Of course, Fade. Exactly how did you join them then?~
@762 = ~I don't know what you're talking about, <CHARNAME>.~
@763 = ~I think you do, Fade. How different is your service to Aran from your previous stint as a slave? I get the distinct impression Aran really didn't leave you much choice... it was either join up or rot in a cage.~
@764 = ~Oh, come on, Fade, they gave you an ultimatum! Either join up with us or stay locked up forever.~
@765 = ~No! It wasn't like that... it wasn't. I... No... ~
@766 = ~Who are you trying to convince, Fade? Me... or yourself? Just think about it. Aran didn't really give you much of a choice to say no, did he?~
@767 = ~You do not make... you cannot... I'm not... I--I can't make judgments on my Shadow Master! Like I said, he is fair. He is good to me. I like him. That's enough.~
@768 = ~Ahhh, I see. He's "good to you", is he? So *that's* what this is all about.~
@769 = ~Okay, Fade, okay. I won't push you. Tell me then of how you joined the Shadow Thieves. Was it too good an offer to turn down?~
@770 = ~That is not funny. Aran has taken many a young destitute away from... a hard life. Many youngsters join us, unable to read or write. We teach them, you know? We encourage them to better themselves.~
@771 = ~Hmmm... I take it by "we", you actually mean Aran. You seem to know him quite well. What is he really like?~
@772 = ~Through the profession of thievery? Don't make me laugh! You're as much of a slave to the Shadow Thieves as you were to the Pasha!~
@773 = ~It wasn't like that! It... isn't like that! I... I don't want to talk to you anymore, <CHARNAME>. I think I need to calm down elsewhere.~
@774 = ~(She turns away, her tail lashing, with a look of anger... and something else... in her eyes)~
@775 = ~(She narrows her eyes at you, obviously not amused) No, it isn't. It's not like that. I was caught thieving on his patch. I was locked up. He was impressed by my thieving skills, so he offered me a job. Simple as that.~
@776 = ~Simple as that? So he locked you up and said "join us or I'll throw away the key"? That's not much of a choice, Fade.~
@777 = ~And exactly how is this different from your previous stint as a slave? Okay, you weren't bought, but you certainly didn't join for your own free will.~
@778 = ~That's not true! I am my own woman now! It's never... been that way! I... I don't want to talk to you anymore, <CHARNAME>. I think I need to calm down elsewhere.~

//LT20
@779 = ~(Fade catches your arm and flashes you an uncertain smile) <CHARNAME>... I feel dreadful for getting annoyed at you the last time we spoke. I... I have no excuse. You asked me a perfectly reasonable question, and... I'm sorry I blew up at you.~
@780 = ~Well, I was a little surprised, but I guess you have your reasons. I accept your apology.~
@781 = ~Bugger off, Fade. I've had enough of you blowing hot and cold with me.~
@782 = ~So why did you get angry with me in the first place?~
@783 = ~I do have my reasons... and I thank you for forgiving me. You seem to be doing that a lot, you know?~
@784 = ~It's okay. When people talk like we do, they're bound to disagree at some point, so no hard feelings, okay? But... can I ask why you got angry with me in the first place?~
@785 = ~I guess I deserved that. Will you at least allow me to explain? I really would hate to leave this unresolved, and I think I really do need to talk to someone about it.~
@786 = ~Talk about what, exactly? Why you got angry with me?~
@787 = ~Okay, you've got five minutes. After that... ~
@788 = ~No, Fade. I mean it. I've had enough. You're more trouble than you're worth.~
@789 = ~Then... that's it, then? I thought you... we... Don't worry, <CHARNAME>, I'll stop troubling you from now on.~
@790 = ~(sigh) I got angry with you because... I've been thinking along the same lines myself. The Shadow Thieves gave me a chance to actually belong somewhere... but at what price?~
@791 = ~Sounds like you've discovered a conscience, Fade.~
@792 = ~You don't like being a thief, then?~
@793 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I'm sure you'll understand when I explain it all to you. (sigh) I got angry with you because... I've been thinking along the same lines myself. The Shadow Thieves gave me a chance to actually belong somewhere... but at what price?~
@794 = ~Well, now I know and I still don't care. Good day.~
@795 = ~Maybe. Most of what goes on doesn't bother me. It's just business, after all. But some of the Shadow Thieves deal in slaves, <CHARNAME>, smuggling them into Athkatla for the slave auctions. They don't sell them themselves, but they are still part of it all... and I can't be a part of that!~
@796 = ~I see. And is that all that is troubling you?~
@797 = ~I can see why you wouldn't like that. Have you petitioned Aran to put a stop to it?~
@798 = ~So they smuggle people. If it worries you that much, just turn a blind eye.~
@799 = ~It's not that. Most of what goes on is just business. But I found out that some of the Guild Leaders deal in slaves, smuggling them into Athkatla for the slave auctions. They don't sell them themselves, but they are still part of it all... I can't be part of that!~
@800 = ~That, and the fact that no matter how much I wanted to leave, I couldn't... ~
@801 = ~Do you want to leave?~
@802 = ~Yes you could. Aran has no right to make you do things you don't want to. Do you want to leave?~
@803 = ~Maybe you should have thought about that before you joined, then.~
@804 = ~I've mentioned it, but... he may be the Shadow Master here, but most Guilds are autonomous, As long as they pay their dues, how they actually obtain them is up to the individual Guild Leaders. There's nothing I can do.~
@805 = ~Then maybe you should leave. If you don't agree with what is going on, don't be a part of it. Simple as that.~
@806 = ~You could always leave. Do you want to leave?~
@807 = ~How can you be so heartless, <CHARNAME>? There is no way I could just "turn a blind eye" to it. No one deserves to be a slave!~
@808 = ~Okay, calm down. I suppose I didn't mean it that way. I meant that if you don't like it, don't be a part of it. Just leave. Do you want to leave?~
@809 = ~Well, maybe you should have thought about that before you joined. The Shadow Thieves *are* a criminal organization, after all.~
@810 = ~I... I don't know. Sometimes... yes. But then I have some measure of respect there, and I belong. That's all I've ever wanted, <CHARNAME>--to belong somewhere. I don't expect you to understand that, but it makes all the bad things slightly more bearable.~
@811 = ~I can understand that perfectly, Fade. After years of being an outcast, you want some security. But that security has to be on your own terms, not dictated by somebody else.~
@812 = ~Fade, don't be so weak! Stand up for yourself. "Belonging" isn't such a big deal. Being yourself and living your own life is!~
@813 = ~Belonging somewhere is fine, Fade, but not when it clashes so fundamentally with what you believe. You don't agree with slavery, therefore you shouldn't have to deal in it. Just leave! Simple as that.~
@814 = ~You think I had much of a choice? You were right last time we spoke, it *was* a case of "join us or rot in a cage". I... I don't know what to do. For once, I actually belong somewhere... I'm actually part of something. But them I realize... it's more like being trapped.~
@815 = ~(sigh) I don't want to unburden on you, <CHARNAME>. I just needed to get it off my chest. I don't expect you to understand that, but it makes all the bad things slightly more bearable.~
@816 = ~But it's not as simple as that. I know too much. I'm not high up in the Shadow Thief hierarchy by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm still valued. Aran would be losing not only a member, but a source of income too. I don't think he's appreciate that.~
@817 = ~And since when was it Aran's decision as to what you do with your life? Fade, if you want to leave, I'll stand by you.~
@818 = ~Can't you see it, Fade? He's using you in exactly the same way the slavers did. You belong to him... you are just another commodity. You have to leave.~
@819 = ~Well, it's up to you. I think you know what you have to do, but only you can actually make it happen.~
@820 = ~I know. I am aware of this. One day... well, one day I may... I can't express it, <CHARNAME>. It's hard for me. I can't betray my Shadow Master like that, but at the same time, I want to live my own life.~
@821 = ~Well, thank you for listening to my ramblings. It's nice to know that I do have someone I can talk to.~
@822 = ~I am NOT being weak! I am... I... ~
@823 = ~(sigh) No, you're right. I *am* being weak. It's just that all I have ever wanted, since my... capture and escape... is to belong somewhere. I don't want to betray my Shadow Master, but at the same time, I want to live my own life.~
@824 = ~Maybe I should take a leaf out of your book. Thank you for listening to my ramblings. It's nice to know that I do have someone I can talk to.~
@825 = ~(She pauses, obviously not expecting you to make this offer. After a short while, she gives you a small smile. She then takes your hand and holds it up to her lips, planting a feather-light kiss on your knuckles)~
@826 = ~I doubt you have any idea what that offer means to me, <CHARNAME>. Thank you. But I can't leave yet. I can't betray my Shadow Master like that, but then again, at the same time, I want to live my own life.~
@827 = ~So what would you propose I do, then? Just run away--again? I've run away from every problem in my life, <CHARNAME>. I can't do it again. Better to belong, to be part of something and slightly discontented, than to be on your own and lonely.~
@828 = ~Fade, that's a very weak attitude to take. Stop letting other people dictate what your happiness should be! Stand up for yourself!~
@829 = ~But you wouldn't be on your own. If you decided to leave, I'd stand by you.~
@830 = ~I know. But I'm not ready to make any decision like that... not yet. I don't want to betray my Shadow Master, but at the same time, I want to live my own life.~

//LT22
@831 = ~(You notice Fade looking quite dreamily off into the distance, smiling slightly to herself)~
@832 = ~(ignore her)~
@833 = ~Copper for your thoughts, Fade?~
@834 = ~Oi! Pay attention back there!~
@835 = ~(sigh) It's nothing. I was just thinking that one day, I'd like to travel. I see everything around me, and I just want to keep on exploring... ~
@836 = ~What do you mean? You're an adventurer now! We travel all the time.~
@837 = ~I know what you mean. There are lots of places on Faerun I want to explore.~
@838 = ~I don't. I'd be quite happy to just find somewhere I can call home.~
@839 = ~Oh! Sorry, I sort of drifted off there. I was just thinking that one day, I'd like to travel... ~
@840 = ~You're not here to daydream, Fade. Please concentrate.~
@841 = ~That's not what I meant! I know we travel a lot as adventurers, but we're always fighting and doing things like... oh, I don't know, rescuing cats out of trees. I'd like to travel just for the sheer pleasure of visiting new places.~
@842 = ~So where would you like to go?~
@843 = ~Hmmm... sounds a bit selfish to me.~
@844 = ~Ahhh, I see. I guess I agree with you. It would be nice to visit places just for the hell of it, rather than because you have to.~
@845 = ~(She smiles and loosely links her arm with yours) So where would you like to go most?~
@846 = ~I don't know. There are lots of places. Tell me where you'd like to go, and see if you can inspire me.~
@847 = ~I'd like to go to Icewind Dale... I'd love to see the Ten Towns and the mountains. Plus, I like snow!~
@848 = ~I'd like to go to Silverymoon. They are supposed to have the best library on all Faerun. It's supposed to be a very cultured place.~
@849 = ~I think I'd like to visit Chult... I've always wanted to visit a jungle.~
@850 = ~It's Calimshan all the way for me--hot and exotic! That's where I'd like to visit.~
@851 = ~(smile) I know that feeling too, <CHARNAME>. But wouldn't you like to see the mountains of Icewind Dale, or the jungles of Chult? I would.~
@852 = ~Nope. Icewind Dale would just be cold, and the jungle would be full of spiders and huge, biting insects. I'd be more than happy just to go back to the Sword Coast and stay there.~
@853 = ~I suppose... possibly. But I wouldn't like to do it alone.~
@854 = ~All right, all right. Honestly, give them some divine blood and they think they run everything... ~
@855 = ~Hmmm... I don't really know. I'd like to go to Chult, to see the jungle... and possibly Icewind Dale, to see the mountains.~
@856 = ~What I'd like to do most, though, is to go sailing. Not as a working sailor--just to explore the seas. It'd be so free... just me and the wind and the waves... (sigh)~
@857 = ~Seems like that would be pretty lonely, though. Wouldn't you like company?~
@858 = ~(hold her hand) Fade, you yearn for freedom so much, don't you? You're like a bird battering itself against the bars of its cage, not realizing that the door is already open.~
@859 = ~I wouldn't like that. I don't really like the sea.~
@860 = ~Why is it selfish? I don't mind helping people, but sometimes... well, sometimes it would be nice to go somewhere on your own terms, not because you've been drafted into going there!~
@861 = ~Well, when you put it like that... I see your point. Where would you like to go?~
@862 = ~(laugh) You complete child! Snow is nice, though. I'd love to visit the mountains too.~
@863 = ~(smile) Yes, I've heard Silverymoon is a very beautiful city. I'd prefer to visit slightly wilder places, though.~
@864 = ~I'd love to go to the jungle too! Even though in reality it would probably be full of snakes and biting insects... but we can dream!~
@865 = ~I... don't think I'd like to go back to Calimshan, <CHARNAME>.~
@866 = ~Oh Gods, Fade, I'm sorry! I didn't think. On second thought, I don't think I'd like to go there either... unless it was to kill that bloody Pasha!~
@867 = ~Fade, you have to face it at some point. You can't hide from Calimshan. What happens if we're sent there for some reason? At least this way, I'd be with you.~
@868 = ~Well, I'm not asking you to come with me, am I?~
@869 = ~(laugh) You like your creature comforts, don't you, <CHARNAME>? Well, I can relate to that. I just wouldn't want to do it straight away.~
@870 = ~Neither would I, <CHARNAME>. Neither would I. Visiting all these places wouldn't be much fun without someone to share the experience with. (she smiles and laces her fingers with yours)~
@871 = ~I suppose that depends on who it is.~
@872 = ~Well, how about me?~
@873 = ~(She looks at your hand holding hers for a while, and then looks up at you. She then leans towards you and gently places a kiss on your cheek) Yes... the door is indeed open. And I have you to thank for that. Maybe after all of this... well, we'll see.~
@874 = ~(She smiles warmly at you and as you begin to walk together, she does not relinquish your hand)~
@875 = ~Oh. That's a shame, <CHARNAME>. It would have been nice to... have had some company, if I did ever get to go to sea.~
@876 = ~Well, you'd have to look for company elsewhere, because I only get on boats if I have to. Sorry.~
@877 = ~Well, maybe I'd be able to stomach it, just for a little while.~
@878 = ~Hmmm. In that case, I'll just have to find a way to make you change your mind, don't I? (grin)~
@879 = ~Y-you'd do that? I mean, you'd go up against the Pasha... for me? Why would you want to do that?~
@880 = ~Because he's a complete bastard, that's why! There's no way I'd let him live if I came across him, after what he's done to you. I... you're... my friend, Fade.~
@881 = ~Because he's a monster, Fade. After what he's done to you, and to countless others... I would have to stop him. I couldn't let him live.~
@882 = ~(She smiles despite herself) You'd go to Calimshan with me, if need be? Then I'm sure to be safe. Not just from the Pasha, but from all the bad memories as well.~
@883 = ~(grin) I'm sure I could take your mind off any problems... ~
@884 = ~You can't use me as your security blanket, Fade. I'd go with you, but you'd need to face up to your fears yourself. But not alone, if you get my meaning.~
@885 = ~(She looks crestfallen for a moment, but quickly composes herself) No, I suppose you're not. It probably would be best if you went alone, anyway.~
@886 = ~(A warm smile suffuses her face as she takes your hand) You'd be my first choice, <CHARNAME>.~
@887 = ~(grin) You never know. We might find a nice tropical beach where we could laze in the sun all day eating exotic fruit. I'm sure that would more than make up for any sea-going discomfort!~
@888 = ~You and your imagination! It would be nice though, wouldn't it? Warm weather, good company... you couldn't ask for any more, could you?~
@889 = ~Lazing in the sun and eating fruit? Come on, Fade. I'm sure we can think of better ways to spend our time... ~
@890 = ~Ahhh... it's nice to dream, but I doubt it would ever happen. Oh well.~
@891 = ~(She looks at you intently and then takes your hand) Thank you, <CHARNAME>. (she then leans towards you and places a feather-light kiss on your cheek)~
@892 = ~(smile) That's very... honourable of you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you. Too many people have suffered to satisfy him.~
@893 = ~(She arches an eyebrow at you) I'm sure you could, <CHARNAME>.~
@894 = ~(She then gives you a decidedly rapacious grin and allows her eyes to travel the length of your body) I'm sure you could.~
@895 = ~(sigh) Yes, I know what you mean. You're very good to me, and so I mustn't use you as my shield against the world. But just knowing that you would be there... that would give me all the strength I would need.~
@896 = ~(She flashes you a wicked grin and raises her eyebrows at you) Well... *I* could.~
@897 = ~(grin) I'm sure we could, <CHARNAME>.~
@898 = ~(She then gives you a decidedly rapacious grin and allows her eyes to travel the length of your body) I'm sure we could.~
@899 = ~(sigh) I suppose not. Still, better to dream than to have nothing and all that nonsense, eh?~
@900 = ~(She takes your hand) Come on, <CHARNAME>, maybe we can dream some more another time.~
@901 = ~You know where I'd like to go most, <CHARNAME>? I'd love to go sailing. Not as a working sailor--just to explore the seas. It'd be so free... just me and the wind and the waves... (sigh)~

//LT26
@902 = ~Mmm. N... No... NO!! KEITA! KEITA!!~
@903 = ~Fade! Wake up! You're having a nightmare.~
@904 = ~(pick up a stick and throw it at her) Fade! Shut up! Some of us are trying to sleep.~
@905 = ~(go over to her, but wait and see if she wakes up by herself)~
@906 = ~(Her eyes snap open, but she doesn't seem to recognise you. She pulls a knife from her belt. Obviously still half-trapped in her nightmare, she lunges for you)~
@907 = ~By the Gods, Fade, what are you doing?!~
@908 = ~(try to grab her wrist) Fade, it's me! Wake up!~
@909 = ~What the... are you insane?!? What in the Nine Hells do you think you're doing?~
@910 = ~(She sits up with a jolt, a dagger in her hand) Huh?~
@911 = ~You were having a nightmare. Are you all right?~
@912 = ~I told you to shut up. I'm trying to sleep. If you're going to make such a racket, you can sleep elsewhere.~
@913 = ~You were having a nightmare... is that a dagger in your hand? You pulled a *dagger*? What were you going to do, stab me? I'm glad I threw the stick now.~
@914 = ~(She continues to thrash about, and continues to moan and shriek disjointedly about someone called Keita. With a scream she suddenly she sits bolt upright, and looks around her, bewildered and panting. You then realise that she is crying)~
@915 = ~It's okay now, Fade, you're awake. It was just a nightmare.~
@916 = ~Why are you blubbering? It was just a nightmare, nothing worth getting upset over. If I knew you were going to crack up on me, I wouldn't have bothered coming over.~
@917 = ~Fade, it's me. Are you okay?~
@918 = ~What? (she glances down at her hand, and with a look of horror, drops the dagger)~
@919 = ~Oh, gods, no... I'm so sorry. I didn't mean... ~
@920 = ~Why did you do that? You were having a nightmare. I was only trying to wake you.~
@921 = ~It's okay, Fade, you were having a nightmare. You're awake now. There's no need to apologise.~
@922 = ~What the in the Nine Hells are you playing at? Why are you getting upset? You were just about to disembowel me, or at least make the attempt!~
@923 = ~(With a scream she wrenches her wrist from you, and turns on you with renewed purpose. Suddenly she stops and looks around her, bewildered)~
@924 = ~Where is... what happened? Why am I... (she glances down at the dagger, and a look of horror creeps across her face)~
@925 = ~What am I doing? Oh, gods, I'm so sorry. I thought... but it was so real... ~
@926 = ~(She shakes her head, as if trying to dislodge the last remnants of the nightmare, and then looks at you, her eyes bright with tears) I can't apologise enough.~
@927 = ~You were having a nightmare... a pretty nasty one too, by the look of it. You don't need to apologise.~
@928 = ~What are you doing? Have you totally lost it?!~
@929 = ~You attacked me, Fade. Why did you do that? I know you were having a nightmare, but I was only trying to wake you.~
@930 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, I truly am. The dreams, they can be so real... when I'm in their grip, I can't break free! All I can see is her bleeding on the floor, knowing there is nothing I can do... ~
@931 = ~What? Who is bleeding on the floor? Is it "Keita"? Is that who you are talking about, Fade? You're not making much sense.~
@932 = ~I'm sorry, Fade. I was just startled, that's all. You don't need to apologise.~
@933 = ~Well, you can go and sleep elsewhere. I don't need to be attacked by a psychotic elf who doesn't know what's real and what's in her dreams!~
@934 = ~(At first she shrinks away from you, her obvious fear and uncertainty making her wary, but then buries her head in your shoulder. She is trembling and is obviously trying to suppress a sob)~
@935 = ~I'm sorry! I can't help it... I try to block them out, the dreams, but they surface over and over. All I can see is her lying on the floor, bleeding... and there's nothing I can do! All I can do is watch... ~
@936 = ~Who is lying on the floor, Fade? Is it "Keita"? You kept on calling out for someone called Keita. I've never heard you talk about her before.~
@937 = ~It's okay, you're awake now. It was all just a nightmare, it can't hurt you... ~
@938 = ~What are you talking about? Surely you know that what is in your head isn't real, and that it's nothing worth getting upset about. Come on, pull yourself together!~
@939 = ~How... how can you say that? You have no idea... ~
@940 = ~No. You're not worth it. Only she was ever worth it. I... I think I'm going to sleep elsewhere. Please, don't bother with me if I wake you again. As you said yourself, it's not worth it.~
@941 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, I am... I will be fine. I'm sorry that I woke you.~
@942 = ~It's all right, there's no need to apologise. It was just a nightmare, it can't hurt you.~
@943 = ~Who's Keita? You kept muttering something about someone called Keita. I've never heard you mention them before.~
@944 = ~As you should be! Maybe you should sleep elsewhere, so you don't disturb me further.~
@945 = ~I'm really, really sorry, <CHARNAME>, but when you've lived on the streets, you soon learn... I really didn't realise it was you! I would never... the dreams can be so real sometimes. She's lying there, on the floor, there's always blood, and there's nothing I can do! Nothing!~
@946 = ~It's all right, there's no need to apologise. It was just a nightmare, it can't hurt you.~
@947 = ~But I do need to apologise! I... I attacked you! It's a reflex you see, from when I lived on the streets... but that doesn't make it right! I shouldn't have... I would never... it's the dreams, they can be so real sometimes. I can't help her, I can't go to her. She is just lying there, bloodied and beaten... there's nothing I can do!~
@948 = ~Keita? I was talking about Keita?~
@949 = ~I couldn't save her! I... I... should have, though! She was everything to me... but now she's gone, and it's my fault!~
@950 = ~I can't talk about this now... I can't... it's too much. I'm sorry, but I can't!~
@951 = ~(She clings to you) Please don't leave me, <CHARNAME>... ~
@952 = ~It's all right. You can tell me another time, if you want to. Just lie down, I won't leave you.~
@953 = ~What has gotten into you, Fade? Why are you being so clingy? I can see your dream upset you, but surely you know what's in your head isn't real, that it's not worth getting upset about. Come on, now, pull yourself together!~
@954 = ~I won't leave you, but you have to tell me what this is all about. Please?~
@955 = ~(As if in a daze, Fade gathers her things and moves away from the rest of the group. As she leaves, she gives you a look that is full of both profound hurt and bitterness)~
@956 = ~But it *does* hurt, <CHARNAME>. I can't escape it! Sometimes I feel as if I'm haunted. I... I can't explain it better than that. Keita was everything to me... and now she's gone.~
@957 = ~Thank you... for understanding.~
@958 = ~(She curls into a tight ball next to you, with her head on your shoulder, and closes her eyes. Slowly you feel her relax as she begins to trance again, and gradually the haunted look on her face gives way to a much more peaceful visage)~
@959 = ~I really can't tell you... not now. Later, when I've had time to... please?~
@960 = ~Okay, I don't want to push you. Tell me when you're ready. Come on now, lie down, I won't leave you.~
@961 = ~No, Fade. Tell me now. If you won't, it's obviously not worth it.~

//Post-kidnapping talk
@962 = ~(You find her sitting on her own, trying to remove her undershirt. It seems to have stuck somewhat to her back, and each time she pulls, it makes her whimper, obviously pulling against her abused back)~
@963 = ~(leave her alone to deal with her wounds)~
@964 = ~Here, let me help you with that.~
@965 = ~(You pick up a damp rag and help her ease the cloth away from her skin. You grimace slightly as the scabs tear afresh and begin to bleed, but there is nothing you can do about it. A shuddering sob escapes Fade's lips as you eventually remove the shirt. Her back is criss-crossed with angry red stripes, fresh blood welling up within them)~
@966 = ~Thank you. I can deal with the rest of it. You don't have to.~
@967 = ~No, I'll help you. Do you want me to get some healing spells together? That should sort this out quickly enough.~
@968 = ~Okay... as long as you're sure. If you need me, just yell. I'll be here as quickly as I can.~
@969 = ~Fade, I didn't realize they'd beaten you quite so badly. They didn't do... anything else... to you, did they?~
@970 = ~No, it would be a waste of spells. I'll be all right. They're only flesh wounds, after all. I just need to get clean and rest.~
@971 = ~I know better than to argue with you, but at least take this potion, to help you heal. Do you need help cleaning your wounds?~
@972 = ~Okay, as long as you're sure. Do you need any help cleaning your wounds?~
@973 = ~Fair enough. I'll leave you to it, then. If you need me, just yell. I'll be here as quickly as I can.~
@974 = ~I will, <CHARNAME>. And... thank you again.~
@975 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. They didn't do anything else to me. Not this time. Why do you ask?~
@976 = ~Because the beating you've taken makes me feel sick enough. I... couldn't stand the thought of you being abused in other ways, too. Not when I should have been there to prevent it.~
@977 = ~No reason. I'm just... glad they didn't.~
@978 = ~Okay. Thanks.~
@979 = ~(She takes the potion from you and swigs it down, making a face as she does) Yeuch. You would think they'd make these things taste better, wouldn't you?~
@980 = ~(She reaches for a clean cloth and dips it in the already bloody water)~
@981 = ~That water needs to be changed if you want to clean your wounds, Fade. Let me do it for you.~
@982 = ~(watch her begin to clean her wounds)~
@983 = ~(She reaches for a clean cloth and dips it in the already bloody water) I... should be fine, <CHARNAME>.~
@984 = ~No, I think I should help you. There's no way you'll be able to reach the wounds on your back, and they'll need to be bound.~
@985 = ~<CHARNAME>... please, don't think like that. There's absolutely nothing else you could have done. This is hardly the worst beating I have taken, and flesh soon heals. It is enough for me that you came to... save me from them.~
@986 = ~(She tries to smile, but her split and swollen lip makes it hard for her) I just need to clean these wounds and get some rest. I'll be all right.~
@987 = ~Here, I'll help you. Do you want me to get some healing spells together? That should sort this out quickly enough.~
@988 = ~Well, if you need me, just yell. I'll be here as quickly as I can.~
@989 = ~(She tries to smile, but her split and swollen lip makes it hard for her) So am I. You don't have to stay. I just need to clean these wounds and get some rest. I'll be all right.~
@990 = ~No, I do need to stay. Do you want me to get some healing spells together? That should sort this out quickly enough.~
@991 = ~(She watches you as you leave to get fresh, hot water. When you return, she nods to you gratefully and tosses a couple of pungent-smelling leaves into the water--you recognize the aroma of some common cleansing herbs)~
@992 = ~(Taking up the cloth, you steep it in the water. For a moment, Fade looks rebellious, and you wonder if she is going to allow you to clean her wounds for her; you know how brittle her pride can be. But then, to your relief, she nods slowly and lies on her belly)~
@993 = ~(In order to have clear access to her back, you pin up her long red hair, still matted with blood. No matter how gentle you try to be, she still winces as you clean the lash-wounds)~
@994 = ~I'm sorry. I'm trying to be as gentle as possible.~
@995 = ~Fade, please try to keep still. I know it hurts, but the stiller you are, the quicker I can get this done.~
@996 = ~(She begins by cleaning the wounds on her arms and then turns herself away from you so she can clean her back, obviously trying to maintain some vestige of modesty on her part. It is obvious to you, however, that she cannot reach or see the wounds on her back to clean them satisfactorily)~
@997 = ~Fade, please. Let me change the water and help you.~
@998 = ~I know you are. I... really appreciate you doing this, <CHARNAME>.~
@999 = ~It's the least I can do, Fade. Sit up, now. Let me bandage that up for you, and see to your face and arms.~
@1000 = ~Do you want me to continue, or are you okay to finish this on your own?~
@1001 = ~I'm trying, <CHARNAME>, I really am. I... really appreciate you doing this, <CHARNAME>.~
@1002 = ~(She sits up slowly, still facing away from you, hugging herself, or so it seems)~
@1003 = ~Fade, I can't bandage you with you facing away from me, or without your arms up. Come on, please turn around.~
@1004 = ~Do you... not want me to do this? Would you rather finish it yourself?~
@1005 = ~I... don't think I could do this properly on my own. I think I need you to do it for me.~
@1006 = ~Okay then. I need you to turn around and hold your arms out for me.~
@1007 = ~(Still holding her arms to herself, she turns around to face you--the reason now obvious to you by the small blush that has infused her cheeks. Before, her hair had hidden the fact that she is bare-breasted. Now she has nothing but her arms to hide her partial nakedness)~
@1008 = ~Ummmm... maybe it would be better if you did this yourself.~
@1009 = ~Fade, I promise I won't look, okay? I'm here to help, not to ogle.~
@1010 = ~Yes, maybe it's for the best. I think I can do this on my own. Thanks for your help, <CHARNAME>... I really appreciate it.~
@1011 = ~(Reluctantly, she holds her arms out so you can bandage her back. You turn your head, trying to be true to your word, but you cannot help but notice that her breasts are shapely. You feel your cheeks redden as you place your arms around her and begin to bandage her. When you have finished, she drops her arms and her lips slowly curl into a slightly awkward smile)~
@1012 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I couldn't have done this without you. I think I can do the rest on my own now.~
@1013 = ~As long as you're sure. Sleep well, Fade.~
@1014 = ~No, it's okay. I'll help you with the rest.~
@1015 = ~I think I will, now. Sleep well too, <CHARNAME>.~
@1016 = ~(You get a fresh cloth and begin to gently cleanse the injuries on her face. Fade sighs and places a gentle hand on your cheek)~
@1017 = ~I really don't deserve your help, <CHARNAME>. After all I have put you through today, I would have thought this was the *last* thing you would have wanted to do. Why... why did you come and rescue me?~
@1018 = ~Because I had to. I've become quite... fond of you, Fade.~
@1019 = ~Well, I couldn't leave you there, could I?~
@1020 = ~(Her one good eye widens slightly, and a smile curls at the corners of her lips) And I've become quite... fond of you too, <CHARNAME>.~
@1021 = ~Well... you could have.~
@1022 = ~No, I couldn't. I've become... quite fond of you, Fade.~
@1023 = ~No, I couldn't. Friends don't leave friends behind.~
@1024 = ~Yes, that's true. Friends don't leave friends behind... ~

@1025 = ~<CHARNAME>, I would like to thank you regarding your patience with me, especially after... the other night. I understand that you must be curious about everything, and I... I feel I can trust you. That I can tell you about Keita.~
@1026 = ~Of course you can trust me. I must admit, I am curious about Keita. You hardly ever mention her, yet your dreams are obviously haunted by her. Who is she?~
@1027 = ~Curious? Hardly. I couldn't care less who Keita is. Now stop bothering me and fall back into line.~
@1028 = ~Fade, I'm glad you feel you can trust me and everything, but now really isn't the best time to discuss this.~
@1029 = ~Not "is", <CHARNAME>. "Was". Who Keita "was".~
@1030 = ~She was everything. My friend, my soul, my sister, my guidance. If it wasn't for Keita, I surely wouldn't be here now. We were slaves together... sold together. We were both considered oddities... exotics. She was a half-drow--they are very rare. Keita herself explained to me that most half-drow children are killed as abominations, but as soon as her "family" realised they could make a profit out of her, she was sold along with a handful of unwanted male drow children. When we first met... ~
@1031 = ~(Her voice breaks and a single tear rolls down her cheek)~
@1032 = ~(wipe the tear away and hold her hand)~
@1033 = ~(do nothing, just keep listening)~
@1034 = ~Okay, Fade, I've changed my mind. I don't really want to hear the rest of this. I know your life has been tragic and all, but is all this melodrama really worth it?~
@1035 = ~(For a moment you think she is about to burst into tears, but then to your surprise, she lunges forward and slaps you hard across your face)~
@1036 = ~How dare you! How dare you speak as if Keita never mattered! I guess I was wrong about you... you are nothing more than a spoilt, pampered brat who thinks of no one but himself!~
@1037 = ~No other time will be right to discuss this, <CHARNAME>. Not for me. I... I have to tell you now. I don't think I could bring myself to try again.~
@1038 = ~Okay, Fade, tell me. This obviously means a great deal to you. Who is Keita?~
@1039 = ~I said I don't have the time! It has to wait.~
@1040 = ~(Initially she shies away from you, as if ashamed of her tears, but then laces her fingers with yours and smiles wanly)~
@1041 = ~When we first met, she was the only one who cared. She was the first slave who spoke to me. She kept me safe, in a fashion. I have no doubt I would have been slain as a troublemaker otherwise. I did everything I could to make life difficult. It was Keita made me realise that raging and attempting to slaughter everyone who came within five feet of me was only earning me beatings.~
@1042 = ~She used to tend my wounds after they had finished with me. Luckily we were bought by the same person... a Pasha from Calimshan. He was... cruel.~
@1043 = ~(She hangs her head, pulls her hand from yours and turns away from you)~
@1044 = ~Fade, you have nothing to be ashamed of. Whatever happened, it wasn't your fault.~
@1045 = ~(gently pull her round and wrap her in a hug) You did what you had to do. You can't keep blaming yourself, whatever happened.~
@1046 = ~Please, continue. What happened next?~
@1047 = ~Melodrama?! How many times have *you* had to watch one of your loved ones be raped and tortured over and over, all as punishment for something *you* have done? How many times have your eyes been forcibly opened to witness their repeated violation? And then been left to tend their wounds, only for them to forgive you, to apologise to you for what they had done?~
@1048 = ~(step forward and pull her against you) I... I had no idea, Fade... ~
@1049 = ~I find that very unlikely, Fade. If they had wanted to punish you, they would have beaten you, not your friend.~
@1050 = ~I didn't realise, Fade, and I'm sorry for that. What you went through must have been awful, but it's in the past now. You really should learn to move on.~
@1051 = ~Fine! At least now I know there's room for only one person in your life--yourself!~
@1052 = ~But it *was* my fault. I wouldn't behave--I kept raging out of control. It was fine for the gladiator pit, but when it came to the harem... Pasha Domiguez had spent a lot of money on me. No one else had a Fey'ri in their possession, and he was damn well determined to get his money's worth out of me.~
@1053 = ~They used to try to punish me... to break me... with beatings, torture and... worse, but I had built up a wall of rage. Nothing they did touched me. I didn't care what they did, whether I lived or died. I just knew I had to fight until the bitter end. I wouldn't be broken like some domesticated beast!~
@1054 = ~Keita despaired. She would treat my wounds and try to convince me to calm down, to behave myself. It was during this period that we became closer.~
@1055 = ~I understand. The two of you against the world. No wonder you sought solace in each other.~
@1056 = ~Closer? What do you mean?~
@1057 = ~I would have thought forming any kind of relationship would have been the last thing on your mind, to be honest. I thought you would have concentrated on finding a way to escape. I would have.~
@1058 = ~(Initially she roughly pushes you away, but with a sob she then flings her arms around your neck and buries her face in your shoulder)~
@1059 = ~But the blame lies with me! It was my fault. If I had behaved, they wouldn't have punished her. I kept raging out of control. It was fine for the gladiator pit, but when it came to the harem... Pasha Domiguez had spent a lot of money on me. No one else had a Fey'ri in their possession, and he was damn well determined to get his money's worth out of me.~
@1060 = ~(She drags a hand across her eyes, dashing away her tears, and steps back from your attempt to apologise and comfort her. After giving you a long, measured look, she takes your hand and starts to draw circles on your palm with her fingers)~
@1061 = ~You can't keep blaming yourself like this, Fade. I suppose I can see why you do it, but you're allowing yourself to be eaten up by guilt. I'm sure Keita wouldn't have wanted you to live your life this way.~
@1062 = ~So they used Keita to get to you. That is vile indeed. But how did they know? How did they find out?~
@1063 = ~So what happened next? How did Keita... die? Was it the torture?~
@1064 = ~So you don't believe me? You've seen my scars--I was punished plenty! But I didn't care. The only thing I cared about was Keita... and they knew it!~
@1065 = ~So now you have the whole tale. Make of it what you will. I won't bother you anymore!~
@1066 = ~Move on? How? Maybe I'm not as strong about these things as you are, <CHARNAME>. The torture of my loved one and her eventual death as we finally managed to escape is obviously a weakness, then. Well, strong one, I shall return to the ranks of your minions and continue being weak.~
@1067 = ~Yes, it was solace, though not in the way you might think. The last thing either of us needed was any kind of... physical relationship. I've never had anyone in my life to love, nor to love me. Keita was like the sister I never had. We knew that this kind of closeness would cause problems if we were ever found out, but we... needed each other. It seemed to make the risk worthwhile. Or so we thought.~
@1068 = ~How did the Pasha find out about the two of you?~
@1069 = ~Is that how Keita died then? Through the torture?~
@1070 = ~Well, knowing the risks, don't you think it was a bit... foolish to allow yourself to become vulnerable like that? Not only for yourself, but for Keita too?~
@1071 = ~We became very close, though not in the way you might think. The last thing either of us needed was any kind of... physical relationship. I've never had anyone in my life to love, nor to love me. Keita was like the sister I never had. We knew that this kind of closeness would cause problems if we were ever found out, but we... needed each other. It seemed to make the risk worthwhile. Or so we thought.~
@1072 = ~Like I could choose! Do you think I revelled in the knowledge that if we were found out... (shudder) Of course we thought of escape! Together we plotted and schemed--fruitlessly, as it happens. But when we were together, we could almost forget our predicament. Almost.~
@1073 = ~So how did the Pasha find out about the two of you, then?~
@1074 = ~Did the Pasha go too far and kill Keita through torture then?~
@1075 = ~I still think you had your priorities wrong. You allowed yourself, and Keita, to become ridiculously vulnerable. I wouldn't have done that. You really need to move on.~
@1076 = ~I know. I try to look to the future, to escape from my guilt... but I can't help think "what if". What if I had behaved from the start? What if I hadn't given in to the feelings? What if I hadn't tried to escape? Would Keita still be alive? Would I still be a  slave? I... I get so confused about it all sometimes. All I know is Keita is dead, and I couldn't save her.~
@1077 = ~So, how did Keita die? Was it... the torture?~
@1078 = ~I suppose I know how you feel. I've lost many friends, and I cannot help but feel responsible in some way. But I try not to let it rule my life. You have to accept what has happened, and move on. You cannot change the past.~
@1079 = ~We were betrayed by another slave. They thought to curry favour with the Pasha. They didn't confront us. We were left on our own for a while. I remember thinking it was strange... normally we only managed to steal moments together in the dead of night, but we were left together for a whole afternoon.~
@1080 = ~They watched as we spoke of our feelings, of our hopes and fears for the future. After that, they knew what to do... they knew how to cow me. Keita was always biddable. She did as she was told without question. I was told her torture and brutalisation would stop if I did as I was told--but it didn't.~
@1081 = ~As it turned out, the Pasha had a predilection for sadism, and he seemed to revel in our anguish. He kept us together, knowing we would blame ourselves, knowing that it would tear us apart. That was when we decided that there was nothing else to do. We had to escape.~
@1082 = ~And how did you escape?~
@1083 = ~No, the torture didn't kill her. They used that initially to keep me under control... but also because the Pasha developed a taste for it. He promised that he would stop punishing Keita if I behaved in a manner more befitting for the harem. He lied.~
@1084 = ~I should have known--he was a sadist through and through. He loved the power it gave him. I should know, I've seen it enough in my people's eyes. No matter what I did, how biddable I was, he continued alternately to punish first Keita and then myself, making the other one watch. It was unbearable.~
@1085 = ~Our chance for escape came when he took a liking to the 15-year-old daughter of one of the jailers, Ophelia. He demanded she be brought before him. Brennan, the jailer, knew he would be killed if he refused and his daughter taken away regardless, so foolishly he brought her in.~
@1086 = ~She was put to work in the harem immediately. I used to hear her begging her father to get her out of there, but he was too frightened of the Pasha. Eventually, Keita and I came up with a plan of sorts--we'd all escape together. As a gladiator, my weapon skills were well-honed, and Keita insisted she had previous experience with a blade... we could hold any guards off for as long as was necessary and together we could all seek sanctuary somewhere.~
@1087 = ~With hindsight, I can see it was a poor plan, but we were desperate. It took a lot of convincing to make Brennan see it our way, but eventually his obvious love for his daughter won over his fear. As jailer he had the keys, so our previously impossible task of escaping the cells was now simple.~
@1088 = ~Escaping the palace was much more difficult. Keita and I managed to dispatch most of the guards we came across. We soon realised that staying together made us easier to catch, so I ran ahead with Ophelia in tow. Brennan stayed with Keita.~
@1089 = ~We met up outside the palace... but Brennan was alone. He told me they had come across some resistance, and that Keita had fallen, shot in the back with a crossbow. As... as she stumbled... she vowed she would never be recaptured, and... and turned her dagger on herself.~
@1090 = ~There was nothing I could do. For years I blamed Brennan--he should have brought her body to me--but he was just a weak, terrified man. I tried to go back for her, but more guards poured out of the palace--I couldn't take them all on!~
@1091 = ~Still I fought. I must have been knocked unconscious because the next thing I knew I was in a Calimport slum dwelling with Ophelia tending my many wounds. I couldn't stay there, not with the man who abandoned my only love to die. So I left, alone. The rest you know.~
@1092 = ~But you're not alone, Fade. We're... I'm... here for you now. Please don't ever forget that.~
@1093 = ~That's truly awful, Fade. To go through all that, only to lose her at the end. But you came through it all. Remember, you're not alone anymore.~
@1094 = ~I know it was foolish! Do you think I had a choice? She meant everything to me. Love is not an emotion Fey'ri are normally familiar with. I didn't know what to do, nor how to feel. She gave me something I'd never had before--a true friend, a sister. When we spoke, we could almost forget about our situation during our few precious moments together. Almost.~
@1095 = ~It was very tenuous. Our chance for escape came when he took a liking to the 15-year-old daughter of one of the jailers, Ophelia. He demanded she be brought before him. Brennan, the jailer, knew he would be killed if he refused and his daughter taken away regardless, so foolishly he brought her in.~
@1096 = ~I know, <CHARNAME>, and I must thank you for listening. I haven't really shared that with anyone before. I don't want to unburden on you, but it does help to have someone to talk to. I feel as if something that was festering inside me has now been expunged. I don't trust easily, as you can probably imagine... but I do trust you. Thank you.~
@1097 = ~It was all my fault. I wouldn't behave--I kept raging out of control. It was fine for the gladiator pit, but when it came to the harem... Pasha Domiguez had spent a lot of money on me. No one else had a Fey'ri in their possession, and he was damn well determined to get his money's worth out of me.~

//LT30
@1098 = ~<CHARNAME>, I just want you to know that I am very grateful to you for listening to me last we spoke. I have never really discussed Keita with anyone before, and speaking to you... it's almost as if a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders.~
@1099 = ~Think nothing of it. I'm just glad that it's made you feel better.~
@1100 = ~Fade, you don't need to be grateful. I'm your friend, and friends are here to help you get over such things.~
@1101 = ~You're not still going on about her, are you? I thought we'd sorted that out.~
@1102 = ~It has. I've carried the guilt of her death for so long now, it was almost like a... like a festering wound, one that has now been cleaned and may be able to heal properly at last.~
@1103 = ~Disgusting analogy, but I know what you mean. You needn't be grateful. I'm your friend, and that's what friends are for.~
@1104 = ~So you may be able to get on with your life now, and learn to forgive yourself. As I said last time, you've nothing to feel guilty over. Stop punishing yourself.~
@1105 = ~(Her smile widens, her eyes bright with emotion. She steps towards you and takes your hands in hers) It means so much to me to hear you say that, <CHARNAME>. True friends are hard to come by, especially ones that will listen to you whinge and moan about so much!~
@1106 = ~(pull her to you and wrap her in a hug) You really shouldn't put yourself down in such a way, you know? What happened to you and Keita was atrocious, and yet here you are, going strong.~
@1107 = ~Oh, come now, Fade. Stop it. Such self-pity is unbecoming, and I don't expect it from you.~
@1108 = ~I... I was actually thanking you for helping me, <CHARNAME>, but if you're going to be an arse about it, you can just bugger off.~
@1109 = ~It's hard, <CHARNAME>, but I will try. Such behaviour soon becomes habit. (sigh) You must be absolutely sick and tired of my whining.~
@1110 = ~(She says nothing at first, but hugs you back fiercely. After a long moment, she releases you and smiles)~
@1111 = ~Keita would have liked you. I'm absolutely sure she would have approved of our... friendship. She wouldn't have wanted me to live like that. Remembering her only in death does no justice for who she was in life. You've made me realize that now. Maybe I can move on. For the first time, I'm actually looking forward to the future.~
@1112 = ~And why not?~
@1113 = ~Fade, pack it in. Such a maudlin attitude is unbecoming of you.~
@1114 = ~(She narrows her eyes for a moment, and you wonder if you've pushed her too far this time. Then, to your relief, she grins)~
@1115 = ~Once again, my friend, you're absolutely right. Keita would have liked you. I'm absolutely sure she would have approved of our... friendship. She wouldn't have wanted me to live like that. Remembering her only in death does no justice for who she was in life. You've made me realize that now. Maybe I can move on. For the first time, I'm actually looking forward to the future.~

//LT34
@1116 = ~(You hear Fade singing, her voice a soft contralto, obviously amusing herself. You do not recognize the song, and many of the words are replaced by "la's" and hums. Occasionally you even hear her mutter "can't remember that bit... " and then continue on with her song)~
@1117 = ~What are you singing?~
@1118 = ~(chuckle to yourself and shake your head)~
@1119 = ~Fade, shut up. You can't even remember all the words!~
@1120 = ~What? Oh. Nothing really. Just a silly tavern song. I can't even remember half the words. Was I bothering you?~
@1121 = ~Well, it was a bit... distracting.~
@1122 = ~No, not really. You have a nice voice. I never knew you could sing.~
@1123 = ~Yes. Shut up.~
@1124 = ~Lalala--what?~
@1125 = ~Well, you could at least learn the words. Why don't you sing a song you know?~
@1126 = ~Nothing. Nothing at all.~
@1127 = ~Oh. I was only singing to amuse myself, but if you don't like it, I'll be quiet.~
@1128 = ~Oh. Was it really that bad?~
@1129 = ~No, you have a very nice voice. It's just that hearing you mutter "what were the words again?" every other line... why don't you just sing a song that you know?~
@1130 = ~No, not at all. It's just that you're distracting me from what I should be doing again. You seem to have made a habit of doing that recently.~
@1131 = ~Yep, sorry. I get the feeling that every enemy in the vicinity knows we're here now. Well done.~
@1132 = ~Th-thank you, <CHARNAME>. I don't sing often, and hardly ever in company. I don't know what came over me... why I should sing now.~
@1133 = ~I don't mind. It makes a welcome distraction. You seem to have made a habit of doing that recently.~
@1134 = ~People normally sing like that when they're happy.~
@1135 = ~I don't know. But maybe in the future you could pick a song you know better? Hearing you mutter "what were the words again?" every other line does kind of ruin it.~
@1136 = ~I don't know many songs, to be honest with you. The Fey'ri have little use for them, other than battle chants, and I'd rather not sing anything I learnt in Calimshan. Maybe you could teach me a song?~
@1137 = ~Okay then. How about this?~
@1138 = ~"There is a tavern down the road called The Devil's Crow
I used to drink and sing there a few short years ago 
But upon one night I lost the will to ever again return 
If you'd like I'll tell you the tale so that ye might learn"~
@1139 = ~"Oh the lasses there were pretty and with them I had reached some fame
But there was one alone who I could never quite tame 
A devilish smile, fiery hair and an evil eye 
To see the rest of this lass, I knew I'd die"~
@1140 = ~"I tried and tried to catch her favour day after day
But she wouldn't budge, always turned away 
Until one night she took my hand, "follow me" she said 
She led me upstairs to the rooms and threw me upon a bed"~
@1141 = ~"Now stories about this girl had been told from harbour to home
So I wasn't surprised when she pinned me down and her hands did roam 
Across my arms and hands then she went into my waist 
Only to remove my coin as she laughed in my face"~
@1142 = ~"I tried to bring my arms to wrestle her away
She had tied them to the bed, I guess I was going to stay 
She got up and opened the door 
She winked, left the room and I saw her nevermore"~
@1143 = ~Oh, I don't know, I'm not very good at this kind of thing.~
@1144 = ~So why *are* you laughing at me?~
@1145 = ~I'm not laughing at you, not at all! It's just that... you could sing a song that you know.~
@1146 = ~I'm not laughing at you. It's just that you're distracting me from what I should be doing. Again. You seem to be making a habit of that.~
@1147 = ~I'm not laughing at you. You have a very nice voice.~
@1148 = ~Really? So what else have I done recently to... distract you?~
@1149 = ~Ahhh... nothing in particular.~
@1150 = ~Oh, nothing in particular. You know, walking, talking, the way your tail twitches when you get excited or annoyed, the way you play with your hair when you're feeling nervous... and especially the way you unbuckle your armour at night.~
@1151 = ~Oh, and I suppose having you traipsing around the countryside, with your pontificating and meddling hasn't already alerted any enemies to our location?~
@1152 = ~(She gives you a rather venomous look, and mutters something you don't understand under her breath)~
@1153 = ~I guess they do, <CHARNAME>. I guess they do.~
@1154 = ~(She touches your arm, almost hesitantly) Do you know any good songs? Ones that you could... maybe teach me?~
@1155 = ~No, I don't. Sorry. Maybe I'm not as happy as you are.~
@1156 = ~I'm sure I've heard that somewhere before, but with *slightly* different words. I'm sure the girl in the song had raven hair... ~
@1157 = ~Nope. Not in my song. In my song, she had fiery hair.~
@1158 = ~Possibly. I really can't remember.~
@1159 = ~I'm sure you'll do fine.~
@1160 = ~No, I really can't sing at all. I'm sorry.~
@1161 = ~(She runs a hand up the back of your neck, making you shiver) Nothing in particular? That's a shame. Well, maybe you could think of something later, and let me know then... ~
@1162 = ~(She runs her hand up the back of your neck, making you shiver) So, you've been watching me undress at night? You should have said. I could have given you a more... private viewing.~
@1163 = ~I see. Maybe another time.~
@1164 = ~(She touches her own red hair and smiles self-consciously) Stop teasing me, <CHARNAME>.~
@1165 = ~(take her hand and brush a lock of hair from her face) I'm not teasing you, Fade.~
@1166 = ~Teasing? This? No, *this* is teasing... ~
@1167 = ~That's rich! You ask me to sing a song I know all the words to, and then you sing a song you don't know all the words to! But... thank you anyway.~
@1168 = ~(She gives you a lingering look, and there is no doubt in your mind that she knows the changing of the words was deliberate)~
@1169 = ~(sigh) That's okay. I suppose singing isn't for all of us. Maybe you have some other... talent you'd like to share with me at some point.~
@1170 = ~And I'm glad of that <CHARNAME>, I really am.~
@1171 = ~(She then pauses, and a rather devious smile curls at the corner of her lips) Well, about this, anyway. Sometimes a girl likes to be teased... ~
@1172 = ~(You trace a finger along her jaw line and then across her bottom lip, and draw her in closer to you. Her breathing quickens, and you feel her shiver slightly) I... see your point, <CHARNAME>.~
@1173 = ~(Fade listens intently as you begin your song)~

//LT36
@1174 = ~(As you settle down to rest, you notice Fade sitting a little way from the rest of you, writing in a little book. She obviously senses your gaze, because she looks up at you and smiles)~
@1175 = ~Just jotting down the day's... misadventures, <CHARNAME>. Nothing to be worried about.~
@1176 = ~You keep a journal too, huh?~
@1177 = ~A journal? Can I read it?~
@1178 = ~Why should I be worried?~
@1179 = ~It's not really a journal. It's just somewhere I can write down my thoughts. I find it helps to sort them out.~
@1180 = ~Come on then--let me see!~
@1181 = ~I've never seen you writing in it before. What kind of thoughts do you need to sort out, then?~
@1182 = ~I know what you mean. I keep one too. I'll let you read mine if I can read yours.~
@1183 = ~Oh. Is that all? Well, don't be too long. The scritching of that quill is beginning to annoy me intensely.~
@1184 = ~(grin) No! It's personal!~
@1185 = ~Oh, come on, just a peek. Or do you have something to hide?~
@1186 = ~Personal, you say? Come on, then, hand it over! I want to find out what you really think of me!~
@1187 = ~Personal? What kind of things do you write in there, then?~
@1188 = ~No reason. I mean, I'm not writing anything negative about you or anything. Or... or anyone else, for that matter.~
@1189 = ~You're not writing anything negative? How about positive, then?~
@1190 = ~Come on then, hand it over. I want to see what you really think of me!~
@1191 = ~Oh, you know... this and that. Feelings, ideas... anything, really.~
@1192 = ~Well, now I'm really curious. Come on, hand it over.~
@1193 = ~Well, I'm sold. Come on, let me have a look.~
@1194 = ~Feelings, eh? What kind of feelings?~
@1195 = ~No, I'd rather not. It's a bit... personal.~
@1196 = ~Personal? Now I have to have a look!~
@1197 = ~Personal, you say? Come on, then, hand it over! I want to find out what you really think of me!~

@1199 = ~(She puts the quill and journal back in her pack, and turns her back on you)~
@1200 = ~Like I'd tell you that!~

@1202 = ~Come on, Fade, play fair.~
@1203 = ~(She laughs as you try to reach round her, trying to prise her fingers from the journal, almost wresting it from her for a moment. Suddenly you both become aware of your close proximity. Fade glances away, biting her bottom lip. You feel her fingers curl round yours)~
@1204 = ~(lean in and kiss her gently)~
@1205 = ~No, this has gone too far. I'm sorry, Fade.~
@1206 = ~(She looks back at you, her expression shifting from confusion to hurt. Abruptly she pulls away from you, and you think you catch the glint of tears in her eyes)~
@1207 = ~Yes, I... I agree, <CHARNAME>. This has gone entirely too far. Excuse me. I... really should go and... and get some rest.~
@1208 = ~(She giggles and shakes her head, putting the journal behind her back. You reach round her, trying to prise her fingers from the journal, almost wresting it from her for a moment. Suddenly you both become aware of your close proximity. Fade glances away, biting her bottom lip. You feel her fingers curl round yours)~
@1209 = ~(You feel her recoil slightly as your lips meet, but just as you think she is going to pull away entirely, she leans into you again, accepting your kiss. You feel her run a hand up the side of your neck, and she gently tugs on your earlobe as her own kisses become more urgent, allowing you to entwine your tongue with hers)~
@1210 = ~(After a while you break apart, and as you stroke her cheek, she smiles almost coyly back at you, but says nothing)~
@1211 = ~Are you okay, Fade?~
@1212 = ~Well, that was certainly enjoyable. But we really should join the others before they wonder what we've been up to.~
@1213 = ~Come on. We'd better get back to the others before they wonder where we are.~
@1214 = ~Why shouldn't I be okay?~
@1215 = ~(She looks at you intently, and then shakes her head and chuckles) Can't get anything past you, can I? (sigh) I've had some pretty nasty experiences in the past involving men. I know I shouldn't tar you all with the same brush, but... Let's not spoil the mood, huh? I'm even beginning to remember that all men aren't complete bastards, because of you.~
@1216 = ~Why, thank you, Fade. That's possibly one of the biggest compliments anyone has ever paid me. But we really should join the others before they wonder what we've been up to.~
@1217 = ~And why would you think that? What kind of "nasty experiences" are we talking about here?~
@1218 = ~(You stand up and offer her your hand, which she accepts. As she begins to stand, you haul her up so she falls forward into your arms. She shrieks slightly as she falls forwards, and then swats you playfully once she finds her feet again, giving you a mock-disapproving look)~
@1219 = ~You're not funny, you know. That's the oldest trick in the book! Come on, jester. We'd better get back to the others.~
@1220 = ~I think you can guess. I was a slave, remember? I really don't want to think about it right now.~
@1221 = ~I can understand that. I'm sorry I brought it up. We really should join the others before they wonder what we've been up to.~
@1222 = ~I can understand that. I'm sorry I brought it up. Perhaps we should join the others before they wonder where we are?~

//LT38
@1223 = ~(The day has been hard, and you decide it is time for a little breather. You sit down and reach for your waterskin, slaking your thirst. Fade wanders over and sits down next to you. She says nothing and smiles rather awkwardly, obviously remembering your last encounter)~
@1224 = ~(Offer her your waterskin)~
@1225 = ~Are you okay?~
@1226 = ~(Get up and move away from her)~
@1227 = ~(She continues to smile, and takes your proffered waterskin. She takes a huge gulp, and then hands it back. You cannot help but notice the slightly nervous edge to her voice when she speaks) Thanks.~
@1228 = ~No problem.~
@1229 = ~(Small roses of colour rise on her cheeks) I'm fine.~
@1230 = ~(She pauses and seems to study her fingernails for a moment) We... don't seem to have spoken much recently, have we?~
@1231 = ~Not much.~
@1232 = ~Well, we've been busy.~
@1233 = ~Nope, and that's the way I like it.~
@1234 = ~(She gets up and follows you) <CHARNAME>, we really need to speak about this! It was... just a kiss.~
@1235 = ~Just a kiss? What do you mean by *just* a kiss?~
@1236 = ~I know, and now I regret it. I should never have allowed it to happen. I'm sorry, Fade, but I can't carry on like this.~
@1237 = ~(Both of you sit there, an uncomfortable silence between you. Fade then sighs)~
@1238 = ~<CHARNAME>... about the other day. We don't seem to have spoken much since then.~
@1239 = ~Not since... you know.~
@1240 = ~Not since we kissed, you mean.~
@1241 = ~Yeah, I know. Can we please drop it?~
@1242 = ~I know. It just seems that since we shared that kiss, things haven't been... quite the same between us. It was just a kiss, after all.~
@1243 = ~Oh. I see. I take it you regret what happened, then.~
@1244 = ~Yes, I do. I should never have allowed it to happen. I'm sorry, but I can't carry on like this.~
@1245 = ~Yes, I do. I'm sorry, Fade, but I'm not interested in you in that way. What happened the other night was a mistake. One I don't plan on making again.~
@1246 = ~I didn't mean it to sound like that, <CHARNAME>. It's just that if you... regret it, I don't want it to get in the way of our friendship.~
@1247 = ~Of course I don't regret it. I was kind of hoping something like this might happen between us. Do you regret it?~
@1248 = ~Yes, I do regret it, but I agree that it shouldn't become an issue between the two of us. Lets just chalk that one up to experience, okay?~
@1249 = ~It has already got in the way of our friendship, Fade. I'm sorry, but I don't think it can ever be the same between us again. It should never have happened--it was a mistake.~
@1250 = ~Fine. So we can't even be friends, then. Well, if that's the way you want it, that's the way you'll get it. Consider me warned off.~
@1251 = ~Yes. Do you... regret it?~
@1252 = ~<CHARNAME>, I don't want to embarrass you, but we really should talk about this, before it gets blown out of all proportion.~
@1253 = ~Fade, I think you've already done that yourself. I don't know what it meant to you, and I agree that it shouldn't become an issue between the two of us. Lets just chalk it up to experience, okay?~
@1254 = ~Please, just let me deal with this in my own way, I don't regret what happened, not at all. I just find it this kind of thing hard to talk about, that's all.~
@1255 = ~But I don't want to talk about it. It was a mistake.~
@1256 = ~Of course I don't regret it. I was just worried that I'd made a fool of myself. Again. It wouldn't be the first time.~
@1257 = ~No, you haven't made a fool of yourself. And to prove it... ~
@1258 = ~I know that sentiment well. I was worried about the same thing!~
@1259 = ~Okay. We can still be friends though, so that's... good. Fine.~
@1260 = ~Yes. I can see now that it was a mistake. I'm glad that's out of the way now. Let's just continue on. I won't be troubling you again.~
@1261 = ~That's... very sweet, <CHARNAME>.~
@1262 = ~(She moves closer to you and loosely wraps an arm around your waist) I'm glad you don't regret it. I was worried I'd made a complete fool of myself. It wouldn't be the first time.~
@1263 = ~No, you haven't made a fool of yourself. I'm just unused to such a show of emotion.~
@1264 = ~(You feel her smile under your lips, and she responds to your kiss with enthusiasm. When you eventually break apart, she grins cheekily at you)~
@1265 = ~You know, this gets better each time.~
@1266 = ~(kiss her again)~
@1267 = ~And is that meant to be a compliment?~
@1268 = ~Good, but we can't spend the day dallying here. Come on.~
@1269 = ~Business as usual, <CHARNAME>? Don't worry. I'm sure we can find plenty of opportunities for... dallying... in the near future.~
@1270 = ~You never have to worry about that with me, <CHARNAME>. Ever.~
@1271 = ~(lean over and kiss her)~
@1272 = ~I'm glad to hear that, Fade. I really am.~
@1273 = ~I'm glad too, <CHARNAME>. All this is a little... overwhelming, isn't it? But I'm glad too... ~
@1274 = ~That's okay. Not everyone feels comfortable with such things. Maybe it is something you will get more used to with time.~
@1275 = ~I'm sure I will, Fade.~
@1276 = ~So am I, <CHARNAME>. And I'd be happy to help you... get used to it.~
@1277 = ~(This time you take things slower, turning Fade's teasing methods on to her. When you break apart, she is looking rather pink and flustered, her pupils huge within her crimson eyes, her tail making a sinuous dance behind her. Her smile has now lost its cheeky edge, taking on a somewhat more hungry bearing. When she speaks, her voice is low and husky)~
@1278 = ~Now *that* kind of behaviour could get a boy into serious trouble.~
@1279 = ~Most definitely, <CHARNAME>... and I look forward to testing out my little theory in the near future!~

//LT44
@1280 = ~(You notice that Fade has been a little preoccupied all day, and keeps coming over to you as if she wants to say something, but walking away at the last moment, giving you long and thoughtful looks each time. After a while she makes her way back to you again, and opens her mouth as if to say something, but then looks around at your companions nearby, shakes her head and walks away again. But this time the look she throws you is lingering and full of longing--it is obvious she wishes to speak to you, but in a slightly more private setting)~
@1281 = ~(follow her)~
@1282 = ~(leave her alone)~
@1283 = ~(She stops a little way from the rest of the group and turns. She is smiling, but it is a nervous smile, with none of the usual teasing undertones)~
@1284 = ~I am... glad you chose to follow me, <CHARNAME >. I did wonder if you would take the hint. I... I... ~
@1285 = ~(She sighs and smiles nervously again, and then begins to play with a lock of her bright crimson hair. You wait for a moment, but it is obvious that she is unsure of what to say next)~
@1286 = ~Fade, come on, spit it out. Why did you drag me over here?~
@1287 = ~Are you okay, Fade?~
@1288 = ~Well, if you're going to play stupid games, I'm going back to the others.~
@1289 = ~What's up, honeykitten? You seem a bit out of sorts.~
@1290 = ~(As soon as she realises you're not following her, she quickly comes back to the group and gingerly touches your arm) <CHARNAME>... may we speak? Privately?~
@1291 = ~Okay.~
@1292 = ~Not now. I'm really quite busy.~
@1293 = ~I... didn't intend to drag you over here. And I don't think I'm... ready to share my thoughts with you at the moment. I'm sorry for having bothered you.~
@1294 = ~No, I'm sorry. I meant it in jest, I wasn't being serious. I should probably learn to read situations a bit better, huh?~
@1295 = ~What's wrong now? You've been acting weird all day, then you obviously want to tell me something, so I follow you, and then... you've got nothing to say! Come on, Fade, you've got to give me something to work with here.~
@1296 = ~So you drag me over here and then tell me you're not ready to tell me whatever it is that you so obviously want to share! Make up your mind! I'm not telepathic, you know! Well, I'll tell you something. I'm not interested, okay?~
@1297 = ~I'm fine. Yes... fine. I... I... just have something to tell you.~
@1298 = ~Oh, why is this so hard? You would have thought it would be the easiest thing in the world.~
@1299 = ~What's so hard? You know you can tell me anything. I will listen.~
@1300 = ~What's so hard, honeykitten? Nothing is worth agonising over this much, surely.~
@1301 = ~Talking to yourself is the first sign of madness, you know. Maybe you should tell me whatever it is on your mind, get it out in the open. You'll feel better afterwards, believe me.~
@1302 = ~Fine, then. Wouldn't want to bother you.~
@1303 = ~Honeykitten? Where did that come from? I've been called many things in my life, but never that!~
@1304 = ~Seems like an appropriate nickname for you, if you ask me.~
@1305 = ~Oh, nothing. I don't know why I called you that. Just a silly nickname, you know. Seemed like the right thing to say.~
@1306 = ~Just a nickname. I don't mean anything by it. What did you want to say?~
@1307 = ~<CHARNAME>, this really is quite important to me.~
@1308 = ~All right, if it means that much to you.~
@1309 = ~Fade, I said no and I mean no! What the hell could be so important that it warrants such secrecy?~
@1310 = ~Apology accepted. Maybe I shouldn't be so sensitive. It's just that... what I have to tell you... is serious. Very serious, okay?~
@1311 = ~Okay, Fade, I understand. So what is it you have to tell me?~
@1312 = ~I don't like where this is going. I'm sorry, Fade, but I have to stop you there. Whatever it is you want to confess, I don't think I want to know. I value your friendship and all, but... sorry.~
@1313 = ~So I'm weird, huh? I was trying to work up the courage to... to... tell you something important, and all you can do is insult me?~
@1314 = ~Fade, that's not what I meant! I meant you've been acting weird, all jumpy and over-sensitive. And I don't mean that to insult you. I'm just saying that you're not yourself. So, what's wrong?~
@1315 = ~Fine, fine. So, what *is* wrong?~
@1316 = ~Good! I'm glad you're not interested! And to think I actually thought I loved you, you self-absorbed, self-important bastard! Well, now I know, <CHARNAME>. Thanks for opening my eyes before I made a total fool of myself!~
@1317 = ~Love? Oh, Fade. I'm so sorry. I'm tired and cranky, and I know that's not much of an excuse. In fact, it's no excuse. And, well, you're not making a fool of yourself. Not at all. Quite the opposite, really.~
@1318 = ~This was going to be some feeble confession? Well, I'm sorry to piss on your bonfire, Fade, but it was never going to happen. You're good for a laugh and all, but me and you, in love? I don't think so.~
@1319 = ~I know you will. It's just... this doesn't come easily to me.~
@1320 = ~I... I don't know how to say this, so I'll keep it short. I... I think I love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1321 = ~(sigh) What do I mean, "think"? I know. I... love you.~
@1322 = ~I love you too, Fade. With all my heart. (kiss her gently on the lips)~
@1323 = ~Fade, I'm really sorry, but I don't feel the same way about you. I value you as a friend and a travelling companion, but nothing more. I'm sorry.~
@1324 = ~You WHAT? I'm sorry, Fade, but I fear you have misinterpreted me here. You're useful, but you mean nothing more to me.~
@1325 = ~So I'm mad, huh? No, you don't have to answer that. Although it has been compared to madness before. Love, that is.~
@1326 = ~Love? And in what context?~
@1327 = ~Love? I see. Maybe we should stop this conversation now, before anything regrettable is said. I'm sorry.~
@1328 = ~Love? I hope I understand you correctly, Fade. Because if I don't, then I'm about to make the biggest fool of myself. I love you.~
@1329 = ~Don't... don't mock me, <CHARNAME>. Especially now.~
@1330 = ~I'm sorry. Please, continue.~
@1331 = ~I'm not mocking you, Fade. It's the truth. Now what is it you want to say?~
@1332 = ~(She blushes slightly and smiles. You both look at each other awkwardly for a moment, then look downwards. She then shrugs, sighs and then chuckles to herself)~
@1333 = ~Oh. I... err... I... ~
@1334 = ~Yes?~
@1335 = ~Can you get to the point already? Talk about blood out of stones.~
@1336 = ~It does.~
@1337 = ~Because... because I can't say it... what I want to say... with everyone else around! Please understand... ~
@1338 = ~Okay, if it's that important to you.~
@1339 = ~Okay. Right to the point.~
@1340 = ~You're right. I have been acting weird. Maybe I shouldn't be so sensitive. It's just that... what I have to tell you... is serious. Very serious, okay?~
@1341 = ~Nothing!~
@1342 = ~Fine!~
@1343 = ~Nothing? So you drag me over here to tell me something, which ends up being nothing, which is obviously a lie! Make up your mind! I'm not telepathic, you know! Well, I'll tell you something. I'm not interested, okay?~
@1344 = ~If it's fine by you, it's fine by me! I can't believe I was about to tell you that--that--something you wouldn't be interested in anyway, you self-absorbed, arrogant bastard!~
@1345 = ~(She folds her arms and looks away from you, obviously upset. After an awkward moment, she looks your way, and you can see tears running down her cheeks)~
@1346 = ~I'm really sorry, Fade. I should never have spoken to you in such a way. I love you too.~
@1347 = ~Wh-what? How can you be so... so cruel?! Well, you'll be pleased to know that my "bonfire" won't be anywhere near you from now on.~
@1348 = ~(She kisses you back, softly at first, then more fervently. When you break apart, she looks to you and smiles)~
@1349 = ~I have felt the same way for... some time now. All the time I thought I might have picked up a severe case of unrequited love.~
@1350 = ~You and me both, then. Although I am glad you said something. It was getting to a point where I was considering doing something drastic to get your attention.~
@1351 = ~Shhh. You don't have to say anything more.~
@1352 = ~I... understand. It was not meant to be. Still, we can be... friends, can't we? Come, let us get back to the others.~
@1353 = ~Useful? After all we have been through together? I can understand that you... may not feel the same way I do, but I had thought us friends, at least. Obviously that is not the case! I am not a mere tool, to be used when it is deemed fit, <CHARNAME>. Goodbye.~
@1354 = ~Context? I... I would have hoped that it might have been obvious, but... ~
@1355 = ~You're no fool, <CHARNAME>. Because... I love you too.~
@1356 = ~(She leans in you and kisses you briefly, almost shyly at first, but as you respond, her kisses become more fervent. After a while, you break apart)~
@1357 = ~We... we should get back to the others now, don't you think? They will be wondering where we are!~
@1358 = ~(You offer her your hand, which she accepts, but as you walk away together, she snakes an arm around your waist. Smiling and feeling very content, you wrap your arm around her waist and both of you make very slow progress back to your other companions)~
@1359 = ~Do you... really mean that? Then this should be straightforward... but it's not.~
@1360 = ~Well, I'm sorry if I'm taking up your precious time.~
@1361 = ~You drag me over here to tell me something that's obviously bothering you and that you so obviously want to share, tell me you find it hard, and when I ask you why, you get all indignant! Make up your mind! I'm not telepathic, you know! Well, I'll tell you something. I'm not interested, okay?~
@1362 = ~(You go to her, and wrap your arms around her. At first she is unresponsive, but after a short while she hugs you back fiercely. She pulls away slightly, just enough so she can look at you)~
@1363 = ~I'm... glad. Don't ever do that to me again, though! I was so worried about telling you... but now it's out in the open.~
@1364 = ~(You lean in and kiss her again. When you break apart, she gives you a slightly amused look)~
@1365 = ~You know, I really am quite curious as to what that "something drastic" was going to be. But now we should get back to the others... they will be wondering where we are!~
@1366 = ~(You lean in and kiss her again. When you break apart, she smiles contentedly at you)~

@1367 = ~Are you all right, <CHARNAME>? You look tired.~
@1368 = ~I *am* tired. I've not been sleeping too well recently.~

@1370 = ~Thank you for noticing. Next time I want the blatantly obvious pointed out to me, I know where to go.~
@1371 = ~Fade, please just leave me alone.~
@1372 = ~I've... noticed. You seem to spend the whole time you're supposed to be asleep tossing and turning, muttering to yourself.~
@1373 = ~Muttering? What do I say?~
@1374 = ~Well, I've got a lot on my mind at the moment. If it disturbs you, you can always sleep elsewhere.~
@1375 = ~You've been watching me sleep?~
@1376 = ~I suppose not. What you've been through would be enough to give me nightmares for a month... although you do seem to spend more time tossing and turning, muttering to yourself, than you do sleeping.~
@1377 = ~I'm only concerned. There is no need to be rude.~
@1378 = ~There is if you keep pestering me with stupid questions.~
@1379 = ~I know. I didn't mean it. I *am* tired, and it's making me a little cranky. I've not been sleeping too well recently.~
@1380 = ~Well... okay. But if you need anything... ~
@1381 = ~I know where to find you.~
@1382 = ~Like what? Being asked stupid questions and having inane conversations? Oh yes, I know exactly where to go if I want that!~
@1383 = ~Unless you have some kind of fantastic remedy for bad dreams and headaches, I doubt whether you'll be able to help me, Fade.~
@1384 = ~Yes. I'll be right here, <CHARNAME>.~
@1385 = ~I don't know. I can never make any of it out. But sometimes it seems like you want something... and other times it seems like you're fending something off.~
@1386 = ~So, I see you've made some kind of habit of watching me sleep?~
@1387 = ~I don't think it would take Elminster to work out what that's all about.~
@1388 = ~I know. It seems like I can't escape my situation even when I'm asleep. But unless you have some kind of fantastic remedy for bad dreams and headaches they seem to cause, I doubt whether you'll be able to help me, Fade.~
@1389 = ~I'm not reprimanding you, <CHARNAME>. I'm just concerned, that's all. This lack of restful sleep must be very draining for you.~
@1390 = ~Yes, it is. But unless you have some kind of fantastic remedy for bad dreams and headaches they seem to cause, I doubt whether you'll be able to help me, Fade.~
@1391 = ~Thank you for pointing that out, Fade. You know, I really wouldn't have been able to guess that on my own. Good thing I have you to point out the blatantly obvious and ask me stupid questions, isn't it?~
@1392 = ~Uh... no. I'm just concerned, that's all. This lack of restful sleep must be very draining for you.~
@1393 = ~I sometimes wonder why I even bother talking to you!~
@1394 = ~I don't know anything that'll stop the bad dreams, but I *might* be able to help with the headache.~
@1395 = ~Really? Go on, then.~
@1396 = ~No, it's all right. I'll be okay.~
@1397 = ~No, neither do I. You're struggling with yourself, <CHARNAME>... your impulses and your instincts. I wish I could help you.~
@1398 = ~I know. I kind of figured that out for myself. Now, do you have any more stupid questions, or do I have to suffer more inane conversation?~
@1399 = ~I know. And I wish you could help me. It kind of worries me a bit. What if I end up giving in?~
@1400 = ~I guess. Although there's nothing you can do about it, unless you have some kind of fantastic remedy for bad dreams and headaches they seem to cause.~
@1401 = ~(She nods, places her fingertips at specific places on your scalp and neck, and with a small smile begins a light massage. At first you feel nothing, but then eventually you do feel some of the tension in your neck leave, and the pain behind your eyes lessens)~
@1402 = ~Does that feel better? I can't do it properly while we're walking along, but it may help.~
@1403 = ~That feels much better, thanks. Where did you learn to do that?~
@1404 = ~Yes, that does feel better. Thanks.~
@1405 = ~Well, as long as you're sure.~
@1406 = ~You won't. You're the strongest person I've ever met, <CHARNAME>, and if you think you are losing it... well, your friends will be here to help you.~

@1435 = ~Is it? I was just looking at my feet and... they're weird. By your standards, anyway.~
@1436 = ~Fade, I'm not looking at your feet. Why are we even having this conversation? This is just too bizarre!~
@1437 = ~By my standards? What do you mean?~
@1438 = ~Why do you keep going on about your feet?~
@1439 = ~(sigh) Yes, I'm the Queen of Bizarre, aren't I? All right, then, <CHARNAME>. We'd better be on our way.~
@1440 = ~(You look at her feet, and realize exactly what she is talking about. She only has four toes on each foot, and her toenails are black and have an almost talon-like quality to them)~
@1441 = ~Eww! That is quite possibly the most disgusting thing I have ever seen!~
@1442 = ~Now that's something you don't see everyday.~
@1443 = ~They are! By your standards, anyway. Go on, look.~
@1444 = ~Fair enough. I was only asking.~
@1445 = ~(Obviously not expecting your vehement response, she contrives to cover her feet up with her hands)~
@1446 = ~I know they're a bit odd, but do you have to be *quite* so insulting?~
@1447 = ~Sorry, Fade. It was just a bit of a shock, that's all. I sometimes forget that you're not just a regular elf with a tail. You haven't got any more unusual... added extras, have you?~
@1448 = ~Come on, Fade. Give me some credit. It's not every day that you get someone shoving their feet in your face, only to find out... to find out... ~
@1449 = ~A bit odd? That's an understatement! Now I know why I hardly ever see you with your socks off. I can just about handle the tail, but that's a bit too bizarre for me.~
@1450 = ~Nope. (she looks up at you, almost apprehensively)~
@1451 = ~I know why you're doing this, and I'm not bothered by your tail, nor your scales, and I'm not bothered by your feet, either. We can't help they way we're made, nor the scars we bear from simply living our lives.~
@1452 = ~They are... pretty unusual, that much I can say.~
@1453 = ~(chuckle) Yes, they are, aren't they? But enough about me. Have *you* got anything odd concealed under that tunic of yours?~
@1454 = ~Well, I don't really have anything naturally odd, but I do have a rather impressive scar.~
@1455 = ~Actually, I do. (lift your tunic) See?!? Weird!~
@1456 = ~I know. Lots of people make that mistake. (she looks up at you, almost apprehensively)~
@1457 = ~Find out what? That the person you're talking to is some kind of freak?~
@1458 = ~No, you're not a freak. I know why you're doing this, and I'm not bothered by your tail, nor your scales, and I'm not bothered by your feet, either. We can't help they way we're made, nor the scars we bear from simply living our lives.~
@1459 = ~No, you're not a freak. Just that your feet are... pretty unusual.~
@1460 = ~I wish I'd never shown you now.~
@1461 = ~I know why you're doing this, and I've gotten used to your tail, and your scales, so I'll get used to your feet as well. We can't help they way we're made, nor the scars we bear from simply living our lives.~
@1462 = ~So do I, Fade. I don't think I'm ever going to be able to forget this.~
@1463 = ~Wait, Fade. I didn't mean anything bad by that. Just that your feet are pretty unusual, that's all.~
@1464 = ~Well, if you can't... best that we don't have so much to do with each other in future, isn't it? I thought you could accept... but I see I was wrong. We'd better be on our way, <CHARNAME>. I think I've had enough of a break.~
@1465 = ~Am I that transparent? But... thank you, all the same.~
@1466 = ~(She picks at the corner of your tunic) So... how about you? Anything odd that you've got concealed under there? Or am I alone the Queen of Weird?~
@1467 = ~Impressive? Now this I have to see.~
@1468 = ~(lift your tunic, showing a row of nasty-looking puckered scars arranged in a crescent shape) I got bitten by a basilisk.~
@1469 = ~(stand up, grin, and begin to unlace your britches)~
@1470 = ~(hold up your hand) I'm missing the top part of my finger. See?~
@1471 = ~She looks at your torso, and then looks up at you enquiringly) I... I don't see anything weird, <CHARNAME>.~
@1472 = ~You don't? How can you miss it? It's my belly button. It sticks out!~
@1473 = ~Oh. Okay, then.~
@1474 = ~Really? A basilisk? You were lucky not to be turned to stone.~
@1475 = ~(She examines your torso) Ouch, that must have hurt quite a lot! (she runs a finger along the outline of the bite mark)~
@1476 = ~Yes, it did hurt quite a bit. Still aches sometimes too.~
@1477 = ~Well, I was kind of unconscious at the time, so I don't remember a great deal of it. I woke up after the healer had finished. I had quite a lucky escape.~
@1478 = ~Err... <CHARNAME>, what are you doing?~
@1479 = ~Like I said, showing you something impressive.~
@1480 = ~Well, my scar is on my hip, and I can't show you if... You did ask to see it!~
@1481 = ~Do you want to see it or not?~
@1482 = ~Oooh... <CHARNAME>! How did you do that? I've never noticed it before.~
@1483 = ~I lost it a fight. A bar brawl, actually. Nothing to be proud of, but... ~
@1484 = ~It got bitten off! By a... err... a dog.~
@1485 = ~In the pursuit of derring-do, my dear.~
@1486 = ~Ooookay... yes, it does indeed stick out! Errr... and that's weird?~
@1487 = ~Yep. Stickie-out belly buttons are always seen as odd.~
@1488 = ~Okay, so it's not in your league, but it's the best I can do.~
@1489 = ~Awww... you don't have to be embarrassed because you're uniformly perfect.~
@1490 = ~Perfect, eh?~
@1491 = ~Fade, stop it.~
@1492 = ~Oh, you poor, brave soldier! Does it need to be kissed better?~
@1493 = ~Fade, don't take the piss!~
@1494 = ~I'm sure that will help.~
@1495 = ~So it seems! At least you're okay now, and you've got something to impress the girls with.~
@1496 = ~There's only one girl I want to impress.~
@1497 = ~I suppose so. Never thought of it like that.~
@1498 = ~That's not the only thing I've got to impress the girls with.~
@1499 = ~Hmmm... who could that be now, I wonder? Come on, King of Weird, we'd better get going.~
@1500 = ~Well, now you are! Come on, then, I think we've rested enough. Let's get going, shall we?~
@1501 = ~Impressive, huh? Maybe I should be the judge of that.~
@1502 = ~(As you lower the side of your britches to expose a long, jagged scar, she gasps and winces) Okay, I take that back! That *is* impressive! How in the Hells did you do that?~
@1503 = ~I was playing up a tree with Imoen. I was about 12, I guess. I fell out of it, and hit a branch halfway down. The branch got stuck in my hip and I was kind of hanging there by my skin--I got into loads of trouble because I should have been studying! Taught me a lesson about climbing trees, though.~
@1504 = ~I said it was! What did you think I was about to show you, then?~
@1505 = ~No, go on. Show me then.~
@1506 = ~(As you lower the side of your britches to expose a long, jagged scar, she gasps and winces) That's pretty impressive, <CHARNAME>! How in the Hells did you do that?~
@1507 = ~That depends *entirely* on what "it" is you're showing me.~
@1508 = ~(lower your britches enough to expose a long, jagged scar)~
@1509 = ~If you're going to make lewd insinuations, I'll go and show my impressiveness to someone else.~
@1510 = ~You want to see *that*? Well, if you insist.~
@1511 = ~That's pretty impressive, <CHARNAME>! How in the Hells did you do that?~
@1512 = ~Ah, well, you could lie about losing it in some fearsome battle. It would give you something to impress the girls with!~
@1513 = ~Oh, poor brave soldier! Would a kiss make it feel better?~
@1514 = ~Derring-do? For some inexplicable reason, I get the feeling you're telling porkies.~
@1515 = ~I'm not! I lost it in a most righteous... umm... bar brawl, actually. Okay, so maybe that's not something I'm particularly proud of.~
@1516 = ~Okay, okay, it got bitten off by a dog. But it *was* a particularly vicious brute.~
@1517 = ~They are? Then you definitely have the... strangest belly button on all Faerun!~
@1518 = ~(She pokes it and giggles, and in retaliation, you poke back at her. Laughing, she ducks out of the way)~
@1519 = ~All right, all right. Stop horsing around, King of Weird! Isn't it time we got going?~
@1520 = ~Well, it's not your fault that you're uniformly perfect.~
@1521 = ~Oh, stop it. You've had your daily allowance of compliments.~
@1522 = ~(She pokes her tongue out at you and begins to pull her boots on) Come on, we'd better get going.~
@1523 = ~Why, are you blushing? Oh, you're just too sweet!~
@1524 = ~(She leans over and places a light kiss on your cheek, making you blush even more furiously)~
@1525 = ~I'm not! But if you ever do need anyone to ever kiss it better... ~
@1526 = ~(She gives you one last lingering look, and then begins to pull her boots on) Come on, we'd better get going.~
@1527 = ~(She shakes her head, grinning, but does lean forward and place a light kiss on you) There, all better now?~
@1528 = ~Much better.~
@1529 = ~Not quite.~
@1530 = ~I'm sure it isn't... ~
@1531 = ~I'm sure it has--don't climb them!~
@1532 = ~Nah. Don't climb them with Imoen after you've spent the morning teasing her and she's just spent a rather busy last half an hour partially sawing through some of the branches!~
@1533 = ~Exactly. Stick to more... earth-bound pursuits, huh Fade?~
@1534 = ~I wasn't sure. It could have been anything, knowing you!~
@1535 = ~(chuckle) You know what? You are possibly the most *terrible* man I have ever met, <CHARNAME>. But do go on... show me your "impressiveness".~
@1536 = ~(She shrieks and covers her eyes) <CHARNAME>! Are you so determined to get me into trouble?!~
@1537 = ~I don't know. Depends on what kind of trouble you're thinking of... ~
@1538 = ~No! I was only joking!~
@1539 = ~Good. But if it ever, you know, gives you any more trouble... ~
@1540 = ~(She quirks an eyebrow and gives you one last lingering look, and then begins to pull her boots on) Come on, we'd better get going.~
@1541 = ~(She purses her lips and tries to smother a smile) Don't push your luck, <CHARNAME>!~
@1542 = ~Only joking? That's a shame.~
@1543 = ~Serve you right! From what you've told me of Imoen, teasing her only gets you about ten times what you give. Come on, we'd better get going.~

//LT42
@1544 = ~<CHARNAME>, may I ask you something... personal?~
@1545 = ~I suppose that depends on what it is.~
@1546 = ~Okay. Shoot.~
@1547 = ~No.~
@1548 = ~I suppose I just wondered... have you... ever been in love before?~
@1549 = ~Of course I have. Why do you ask?~
@1550 = ~No, I haven't. Why do you want to know?~
@1551 = ~I thought I was, once. But now I realize it wasn't the real thing.~
@1552 = ~I really don't want to answer that, Fade.~
@1553 = ~I fall in and out of love all the time, Fade.~
@1554 = ~I... I just wondered. Have you... ever been in love before?~
@1555 = ~Oh. Are... are you sure? I... only wanted to satisfy my own curiosity. It's nothing drastic.~
@1556 = ~Okay, now you've piqued my own curiosity. What is it?~
@1557 = ~You can satisfy your curiosity elsewhere, because I am no longer interested in you or what you have to say.~
@1558 = ~Well, I suppose it would depend on what you wanted to know.~
@1559 = ~Just, you know, curious.What were they like? If you don't mind me asking, of course... ~
@1560 = ~Of course I don't. She was my first real love, and her name was Calia. We were together for about a year. I was about 17.~
@1561 = ~No, of course I don't. I fell in love with one of the stable boys, called Jak. I was about 16 or 17, I suppose.~
@1562 = ~What was Kirsten like? She was great. I had the hugest crush on her, but it wasn't reciprocated. I worshipped the ground she walked on, but she never even noticed me.~
@1563 = ~Ahhhh, my first love. He may have been fat and furry, but I loved him all the same.~
@1564 = ~You haven't? That... surprises me, <CHARNAME>. I would have thought that you wouldn't have had any problems finding love.~
@1565 = ~Why not? It may come as a surprise to you, but I wasn't always this buff and bronzed demi-god you see before you today. I was actually very bookish, and the idea of talking to girls just terrified me.~
@1566 = ~Heh, I didn't say I had any problems in finding love, I've just never really felt anything other than lust for any of my partners.~
@1567 = ~I've never gone looking for love, so there's no reason why I have found it. I suppose I've always believed that when it happens, it happens.~
@1568 = ~Truly? What made you realize that?~
@1569 = ~Simple, really. I've come to have feelings for someone else, and they are far stronger than anything I have ever felt before, ergo I can't have been in love before.~
@1570 = ~Because I'm older and wiser now. For love to be real, it has to be reciprocated.~
@1571 = ~Because I was just a kid!~
@1572 = ~Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry. Maybe I could ask you something else then? Something a little less personal?~
@1573 = ~Okay, as long as it *is* less personal.~
@1574 = ~Fade, I know your game. You'll just ask me the same thing again, but in a different way. So let me set it straight--I don't want to discuss such feelings with you, ever. Okay?~
@1575 = ~You do? How many times?~
@1576 = ~Three or four times a day, normally. Bar wenches, girls walking down the street, tough mercenary girls, all tooled up and ready to fight--I love them all!~
@1577 = ~Fade, I wasn't being serious! I've only ever been properly in love once before.~
@1578 = ~I'm joking, Fade! To be honest, I've never been in love before. Not properly, anyway.~
@1579 = ~(Her face falls, and then her tail twitches and her features stiffen) Fair enough. At least I know where I stand now.~
@1580 = ~What went wrong, then? Why did you break up?~
@1581 = ~She ran off with the blacksmith's son one day. Turns out she'd been seeing him behind my back. I was pretty devastated.~
@1582 = ~We just drifted apart after a while. Although at the time I loved her very much, I suppose it was inevitable that we would split up. We were very young.~
@1583 = ~I... err... ended it.~
@1584 = ~The stable... boy? I see. Were your feelings... reciprocated?~
@1585 = ~No. I don't think he knew I even existed. Well, not in that way, anyway, He married his childhood sweetheart not long before I left Candlekeep.~
@1586 = ~Yep. Many a happy afternoon was spent tumbling in the straw.~
@1587 = ~Errr... no. I don't think he would have appreciated my interest in him.~
@1588 = ~That's a shame. I hope she now realizes what she was missing.~
@1589 = ~I doubt she even remembers me! We were only seven, after all.~
@1590 = ~And why do you say that?~
@1591 = ~Well, considering she was one of my tutors, I really do doubt it.~
@1592 = ~I'm sorry... did you just say "fat and furry"?!~
@1593 = ~Yes. My first love was my pony, Misty. I loved him so much!~
@1594 = ~Well, you didn't specify *what* my first love had to be.~
@1595 = ~(laugh) I see! But you must have felt something for... someone, once? You can't still be terrified of girls!~
@1596 = ~No? Says who?~
@1597 = ~Heh, no, not anymore. To be fair, I've had my fair share of crushes, but nothing serious. (sigh) Nobody loves me... ~
@1598 = ~Women have always been these strange, alien creatures to me. I doubt I'll ever understand them, and they'll terrify me even when I'm an old man!~
@1599 = ~Well, at least you're honest. And... I suppose that's a sentiment I can relate to. But if you've never been in love, how do you know... when it happens?~
@1600 = ~Well, if it happens, I'll be sure to let you know.~
@1601 = ~Easy. Your palms sweat, you feel ever so slightly sick all the time, you find it hard to catch their eye without blushing and you find yourself wondering exactly what they look like under all that armo-- (cough)~
@1602 = ~I think you just... know. It's like an instinct.~
@1603 = ~Are you trying to tell me that you don't know what it feels like to be in love?~
@1604 = ~And... how will you know when it has happened?~
@1605 = ~I... see. So what are these... feelings like?~
@1606 = ~Well, your palms sweat, you feel ever so slightly sick all the time, you find it hard to catch their eye without blushing and you find yourself wondering exactly what they look like under all that armo-- (cough)~
@1607 = ~Yes, I suppose it does. Unrequited love can be very cruel, can't it?~
@1608 = ~You know what it feels like? To love someone who doesn't love you?~
@1609 = ~Yes, it can. I hope it never happens to me again.~
@1610 = ~Oh, I see! So it was nothing more than a schoolboy crush, then?~
@1611 = ~You seem relieved, Fade.~
@1612 = ~Yes. Since then, I've been too busy to fit anyone else into my life.~
@1613 = ~Oh, believe me, at the time I thought it was the big "L", but now I know different. I've come to have feelings for someone else, and they are far stronger than anything I have ever felt before, ergo I can't have been in love before.~
@1614 = ~Well... and this is just hypothetical, of course, I don't mean this to apply to you personally or anything... how do you know when you love someone? What does it... feel like?~
@1615 = ~"Hypothetically"? Fade, that's just as personal as the last question you asked me! Let me set it straight for you--I don't want to discuss such feelings with you, ever. Okay?~
@1616 = ~Hypothetically? Okay... well... your palms sweat, you feel ever so slightly sick all the time, you find it hard to catch their eye without blushing and you find yourself wondering exactly what they look like under all that armo-- (cough)~
@1617 = ~(grin) Oh, stop mucking about, jester! You know what I mean.~
@1618 = ~Okay, okay, I'll be serious. I've only ever been in love once before.~
@1619 = ~Alright. Seriously, I've never been in love before. Not properly, anyway.~
@1620 = ~Can I ask you about it? What were they like? If you don't mind, of course... ~
@1621 = ~That's awful. Has it put you off... finding love with anyone else?~
@1622 = ~What is this? Twenty Questions?~
@1623 = ~What? Put me off?~
@1624 = ~A bit. No one likes getting hurt, but you can't help who you fall in love with.~
@1625 = ~Or maybe that is just what happens when you've been with the same person for a long while. You just drift apart.~
@1626 = ~I don't think that's true, Fade. I firmly believe that once you've found that special person, you'll be with them forever.~
@1627 = ~Maybe so. And you might get run over by a runaway cart tomorrow. All the more reason to live life to the full!~
@1628 = ~That's a very negative attitude to true love, Fade.~
@1629 = ~You ended it? Why?~
@1630 = ~I got bored. Simple really. We were young, she wanted to settle down, and I wanted to travel. It was inevitable.~
@1631 = ~She... caught me out. I was cheating on her. I ended it before she could.~
@1632 = ~Oh. I suppose I hadn't even considered you the type who would, you know... ~
@1633 = ~Be interested in another man? Why not? Why cut yourself off from half the population, just because they are the same sex as you?~
@1634 = ~Why not, Fade?~
@1635 = ~Well, I'm not. Not normally, anyway. Jak was... special to me. He's the only bloke I've ever... felt that way about. I don't know why.~
@1636 = ~You... did? Oh. I suppose I hadn't even considered you the type who would, you know...~
@1637 = ~Ahhhh... I see. Although I hadn't even considered you the type who would, you know...~
@1638 = ~Only sev--what? (She looks confused, but then laughs) Stop mucking about, jester! You know what I mean. I'm not talking about childhood infatuations!~
@1639 = ~No? Only adult ones, then.~
@1640 = ~Okay, okay, a sensible answer. My first real love was a girl called Calia. We were together for about a year. I was about 17.~
@1641 = ~Okay. I suppose my first love was when I fell in love with one of the stable boys, called Jak. I was about 16 or 17, I suppose.~
@1642 = ~(blush) Oh, you know... nothing in particular... just that... ummm... ~
@1643 = ~Hmmm? Just that what, Fade?~
@1644 = ~It's okay, Fade. I shouldn't have put you on the spot like that.~
@1645 = ~Your tutor--what? (She looks confused, but then laughs) Stop mucking about, jester! You know what I mean. I'm not talking about childhood infatuations!~
@1646 = ~What? (She looks confused, but then laughs) Stop mucking about, jester! You know what I mean. I'm not talking about childhood infatuations!~
@1647 = ~(grin) Oh, come now, <CHARNAME>. After the way you've... behaved around me? You're not scared of girls!~
@1648 = ~Oh, that just means I'm not scared of you. (try to pinch her cheeks)~
@1649 = ~Okay, maybe not now, but I used to be. To be fair, I've had my fair share of crushes, but nothing serious. (sigh) Nobody loves me... ~
@1650 = ~I... I wouldn't say that, <CHARNAME>. (Her cheeks flush, and she bites her bottom lip as she hurries away)~
@1651 = ~(giggle) I'm sure you'll meet one who convinces you otherwise, <CHARNAME>.~
@1652 = ~I think I already may have done, but I'm not sure if she realizes it yet.~
@1653 = ~Oh? And what makes you say that?~
@1654 = ~I doubt that! But that won't stop me from loving her, all the same.~
@1655 = ~(She gives you a confused look) Uh... okay, <CHARNAME>. Whatever you say... ~
@1656 = ~Hmm. Maybe you could add the urge to be near them every second of the day, but as soon as you do get near them you end up prattling on about nonsense to them all the time, and being excruciatingly embarrassed by this, but unable to stop... ~
@1657 = ~Uh, yeah. You get the idea.~
@1658 = ~Why do you want to know anyway? Don't tell me you don't know what it's like to be in love.~
@1659 = ~Are you taking the piss, Fade?~
@1660 = ~So even if you'd never been taught, you would know what those feelings meant? You wouldn't be able to... mistake them, would you?~
@1661 = ~Well, I suppose you could. It depends. What kind of feelings are you talking about here?~
@1662 = ~What's wrong, Fade? Are you trying to tell me that you don't know what it's like to be in love?~
@1663 = ~I... I don't know. No one has ever explained how it's meant to feel. I could just have bad indigestion, for all I know. (grin)~
@1664 = ~I have heard many descriptions of how it feels to be in love, but "bad indigestion" isn't one! Although feeling slightly sick can be part of it, as can sweaty palms, finding it hard to catch their eye without blushing and finding yourself wondering exactly what they look like under all that armo--ahem!~
@1665 = ~So you think you're in love with someone? Can I... ask who that lucky individual is?~
@1666 = ~I'm not entirely sure. It depends entirely on whether the other person feels the same way. I... think they may do, but I can't be certain.~
@1667 = ~They do rather like to tease me, you know, and since I'm not really familiar with such... (shrug) Let's just say that I dearly hope they feel the same way, and leave it at that.~
@1668 = ~I suppose that depends on who you choose to give your heart to, doesn't it? (She gives you an odd smile before returning to her place in the formation)~
@1669 = ~Well... I suppose, in a way, I am. I wouldn't like to hear of anyone having to suffer through unrequited love. It can be very cruel.~
@1670 = ~So, you know what it feels like? To love someone who doesn't love you?~
@1671 = ~Yes, it can. Even though I was only young, I hope it never happens to me again.~
@1672 = ~No! Not at all. Like I said, I am merely curious. If you don't like it, I won't bother you anymore.~
@1673 = ~No, Fade. It's okay to be curious. I suppose I was put off the whole love thing for a while. It just seemed another thing I could do without in my life. But you can't help it when you do fall in love, nor who you fall for.~
@1674 = ~Fade, it's not that you're bothering me as such, it's just... it's like you're using me to analyse something. Is there something you want to tell me?~
@1675 = ~Well, being knocked back like that. Once bitten, twice shy and everything.~
@1676 = ~I suppose so. I was put off the whole love thing for a while; it just seemed another thing I could do without in my life. But you can't help it when you do fall in love, nor who you fall for.~
@1677 = ~What are you getting at? It's like you're using me to analyse something. Is there something you want to tell me?~
@1678 = ~Yes, shy. And... unable to get to the point.~
@1679 = ~(She offers you a strange half-smile) You do? Well, that's... comforting to know.~
@1680 = ~I suppose it is. Don't let anything hold you back, right? (She gives you an odd smile and returns to her place in the formation)~
@1681 = ~(shrug) I suppose I just need someone to prove me wrong then, don't I? (She gives you an oddly penetrating look and smiles)~
@1682 = ~You... cheated on her? Well, at least you're honest about it.~
@1683 = ~Fade, it's not something I'm particularly proud of, and I wouldn't do it again. I could never put someone I cared for through that again.~
@1684 = ~These things happen, Fade--fact of life. I never intended to hurt her, it just happened.~
@1685 = ~(sigh) Oh, I agree with you. It's just that I... I suppose I don't like the thought of *anyone* else sharing y-- (She stops and looks to you rather apprehensively, as if she has only just realized what she was about to say)~
@1686 = ~But I'm just prattling on now! I'll just... all right? (She gestures away from herself and offers you a strange half-smile)~
@1687 = ~Well, after... after the other day. You did kiss me.~
@1688 = ~I'm not attracted to people because of their gender, Fade. I never have been. Why cut yourself off from half the population, just because they are the same sex as you?~
@1689 = ~I did. And as I told you then, I don't regret it; not at all.~
@1690 = ~Yes, I did. I've been thinking a lot about that kiss. I should possibly have told you this before, Fade, but I'm not that interested in women. I like you a lot--just not in the way you probably want me to.~
@1691 = ~So, people of the female persuasion do get a look in with you? That's... good to know. It's nice to know that you have loved another, but I was a bit worried for a moment. I thought that maybe you'd only kissed me to... ~
@1692 = ~(shrug) Well, it doesn't matter now. (She gives you an odd smile and returns to her place in the party formation)~
@1693 = ~(grin) Possibly, depending on what they are and who they are with. (She offers you an odd smile and returns to her place in the party formation)~
@1694 = ~(blush) Because... because you're quite a... special person, <CHARNAME>. To a lot of people. And... to me.~
@1695 = ~(She laughs and bats your hands away from her face) You say that now, but just you wait! I can be ultimately scary when I want to be!~
@1696 = ~Although you can be pretty frightening yourself. And not just in the "Son of Bhaal" kind of way. Also in the "messing with people's feelings" kind of way, too.~
@1697 = ~Oh, I think she does, <CHARNAME>. I just think that she is worried about making an idiot of herself. And that she is worried that she may possibly be getting hold the wrong end of the stick. I... dearly hope she's right, though. I don't know how she would react if she found out she was wrong.~
@1698 = ~Because you deserve someone who does, <CHARNAME>. Someone to convince you that not all of us are terrifying, alien creatures. Someone... close to you.~
@1699 = ~So do I, <CHARNAME>. I just hope you're willing to give her a chance.~
@1700 = ~Good. And I'm absolutely positive that she'll do everything in her power to... help you get over your irrational fears. If you just give her a chance.~
@1701 = ~Get the idea? I think I understand it quite well by now. I... I never imagined, though, that I... that... Well, that it would feel so much like being sick!~
@1702 = ~(She flashes you a quick grin, though for some reason not quite meeting your eyes, and returns to her place in the party formation)~
@1703 = ~Of course not, <CHARNAME>! I understand too well what you're going through to tease you like that. Because I've... I... well... It feels a lot like being sick, don't you think?~
@1704 = ~Well... feelings. I don't have to draw you a picture, do I? Just that you feel close to someone, and you want to be with them all the time, and... and... Oh, now you're getting me mixed up, <CHARNAME>! I'll have to take a moment to sort all these thoughts out!~
@1705 = ~(She gives you a rather self-conscious smile, and hurries back to her place in the party formation)~
@1706 = ~Of course you can ask--but I'm not telling you! Not now, anyway. Maybe... maybe later, when I've worked up the courage to... And when I do, <CHARNAME>, I promise, you'll be... the first to know, all right?~
@1707 = ~No, that's true. You can't help it. I mean, I never imagined when I first joined your party that I would--would--~
@1708 = ~(She stops short, a distinct blush rising in her face) You know what, <CHARNAME>? I forgot what I was about to say! Adventuring does sap your memory, doesn't it? Come on, we'd better be on our way!~
@1709 = ~Something to tell you? Does it... does it really sound like that, <CHARNAME>? Then... I... well... then I must not be making very much sense, must I? Come on, we'd better be on our way before I start spouting gibberish!~
@1710 = ~Yes. That's... that's exactly how I feel, at times... ~
@1711 = ~(The two of you stand there in awkward silence for a while, until Fade flashes you a quick grin, though for some reason not quite meeting your eyes) Well, this isn't getting us anywhere, is it? Come on, we'd better get going.~
@1712 = ~Well, in that case, some good has come out of it, hasn't it? And... and I hope, too, that the next person who... who falls in love with you, won't have to go through that again.~
@1713 = ~"Just happened"? I hope that's not the excuse you're going to tell the next woman who gives her heart to you, <CHARNAME>. And in fact, I hope... I hope you won't ever *need* to tell her that excuse.~
@1714 = ~Oh. So it's... like that? This is... a bit much for me to wrap my mind around it now, <CHARNAME>. I mean, after all we've been through and all, I thought... Well, I'm glad you've set it straight now, at least. We're... still friends, of course. Right?~
@1715 = ~And I've told you that I... don't regret it either. I'm not sure how much it meant to you, but for me, I... Well, I suppose we'll have to sort this out someday, won't we?~
@1716 = ~No, it's okay. I kind of set myself up for that one, didn't I? You're quite a... special person, <CHARNAME>. To a lot of people. And... to me.~
@1717 = ~But if you did meet somebody worth loving, wouldn't you... make time for them? Not that I mean anything like... that I'm saying... it was... just a thought. After all, you never know, do you?~

@1718 = ~(Creeping up behind you, she tucks something behind your ear and with a swift kiss and a decidedly girlish giggle, runs away again)~

@1720 = ~(reach for whatever it is she tucked behind your ear)~
@1721 = ~You're in a good mood!~
@1722 = ~(She looks over her shoulder and grins at you) Can't catch me!~
@1723 = ~You want to bet on that?~
@1724 = ~But I bet I won't have to. You'll come back!~
@1725 = ~(stop running and reach for whatever it is she tucked behind your ear)~
@1726 = ~(Reaching up, you pluck the little flower she has placed there. Bringing it to your nose, you find its perfume is sweet and pungent. Looking up again, you see Fade has stopped running and is looking at you expectantly)~
@1727 = ~You seem in a good mood. What's brought this on?~
@1728 = ~(gesture for her to come over to you)~
@1729 = ~(laugh) Why shouldn't I be? (She stops, turns around and runs straight for you, wrapping you in a hug) I've got you, haven't I?~
@1730 = ~(tweak her nose playfully) And I love you too!~
@1731 = ~You certainly have. You can have even more of me later, if you'd like.~
@1732 = ~Fade, not in front of everyone else!~
@1733 = ~(You keep running after her, and with a shriek of delight, she runs on. You catch her easily however, which you realize was her intention all along. She allows your bodies' momentum to spin her around, and then she lands rather heavily on you, a huge grin on her face) So, you caught me!~
@1734 = ~Yep, although it seems as if you have caught me now!~
@1735 = ~(shove her off you and pin her to the ground) I certainly did. Now what am I going to do with you?~
@1736 = ~Oooff! Fade, be careful!~
@1737 = ~Cheeky! (She then gives you a rather calculating look and runs straight at you, knocking you off your feet and landing rather heavily on you) Got you!~
@1738 = ~(grin) You most certainly have.~
@1739 = ~(shove her off you and pin her to the ground) Now I've caught *you*. What am I going to do with you?~
@1740 = ~(With a mischievous smirk, she shakes her head) Nope, you come here.~
@1741 = ~(grin) Oh, come here. You know you want to!~
@1742 = ~Okay, have it your way!~
@1743 = ~Fade, I'm not in the mood to play silly buggers now, not in front of everyone else.~
@1744 = ~You love my nose?~
@1745 = ~Of course I do!~
@1746 = ~You know what I mean!~
@1747 = ~Really? Is that a threat or a promise?~
@1748 = ~(hold her tightly against you) Oh, a most definite promise... ~
@1749 = ~Well, that depends on what you want to be "threatened" with, doesn't it?~
@1750 = ~Well, that kind of depends on you, doesn't it?~
@1751 = ~(She smiles and shakes her head) I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I get kind of carried away sometimes. I tend to forget you are not used to such... open displays. Maybe later then?~
@1752 = ~Maybe later... what?~
@1753 = ~Yes, later is better... when there's no one else around.~
@1754 = ~I'm sure I'll get used to it with time, just not all at once, okay?~
@1755 = ~(smirk) Now then... what to do with you?~
@1756 = ~Are you open to suggestions, or do you want to see what you come... up with?~
@1757 = ~Whatever you want, Mistress.~
@1758 = ~No! Let me go! (She starts to try to wriggle away from you, but soon gives up) Okay, so you have me. What are you going to do with me?~
@1759 = ~Well, I am open to suggestions, or you could just see what I come... up with.~
@1760 = ~(say nothing, just bend your head to kiss her)~
@1761 = ~Oh, I don't know. How about this? (kiss her soundly)~
@1762 = ~Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hurt you, did I?~
@1763 = ~(shove her off you and pin her to the ground) Ah ha! That ploy always works. Now I have you!~
@1764 = ~No, but I'm not used to being cannoned into by pretty girls. Let's save the rough-housing until later when there's no one else around, okay?~
@1765 = ~No, it's okay. I'm just not in the mood to play silly buggers now, not in front of everyone else.~
@1766 = ~Really? What else do you love, then?~
@1767 = ~Well, I may have to save that for later, when we have a little less... company, if you get my meaning.~
@1768 = ~(grin and bury your head in her cleavage)~
@1769 = ~(laugh) Okay, yes I do. And I love you too, <CHARNAME>, with all my heart. (She kisses you soundly)~
@1770 = ~(Her eyes widen) Oh! I... see. Gosh! (She looks down, then looks back up at you) Yes, I would say that was a definite promise... ~
@1771 = ~(She purses her lips and gives you a slightly quirky look) I'm sure you can think of something. I'm sure you have some kind of…tool at your disposal.~
@1772 = ~(grin) Oooh, I get a choice, do I? Well, in that case, you can promise to... threaten me later, okay? (wink)~
@1773 = ~I think I can leave that up to you, <CHARNAME>. Surprise me, okay? (She winks and saunters off)~
@1774 = ~Okay, <CHARNAME>. Until later... (She blows you a kiss and saunters off)~
@1775 = ~(She smiles and kisses you on the cheek) Okay, <CHARNAME>. It isn't a problem.~
@1776 = ~You're a naughty, naughty thing, <CHARNAME>. You do realize that, don't you?~
@1777 = ~You think this is naughty? Just wait until later, then.~
@1778 = ~And you are a filthy little minx for understanding, do *you* realize that?~
@1779 = ~So the choice is mine? Hmmmm... I'll have to think on this and... come back to you later.~
@1780 = ~(She grins lasciviously and for a fleeting moment you wonder whether it was wise to let a part Tan'ari with a broad imagination have such a choice)~
@1781 = ~(Just as your lips meet, you stop short and lightly trace your tongue around her lips. She shivers and her eyes widen) <CHARNAME>! Where on Faerun did you learn to do that?~
@1782 = ~Why? Don't you like it?~
@1783 = ~Just a little... trick I picked up. Works on all kinds of lips. (grin)~
@1784 = ~(She responds eagerly, and when you break apart, she is looking decidedly flushed) You've got to stop doing that, you know. As I've told you before, you really are going to get yourself into some serious trouble one of these days... ~
@1785 = ~Hmmm... I think I do, <CHARNAME>, I think I do.~
@1786 = ~Get out of there, you dreadful thing! They aren't just there for your entertainment! (She shakes her head and sighs as you bury your face deeper) Men... I ask you... ~
@1787 = ~(grin) With bated breath, <CHARNAME>.~
@1788 = ~(She tries to look innocent, but fails miserably) Me? A filthy little minx? (grin) Most definitely, <CHARNAME>... ~
@1789 = ~Err, quite the opposite, actually... Do it again... ~
@1790 = ~(Her eyes widen, as does her grin) Really? Well, that's something to look forward to. (wink)~

//LT48
@1791 = ~<CHARNAME>, love is a funny thing, isn't it?~
@1792 = ~Yes, I suppose it is.~
@1793 = ~(grin) Makes me laugh all the time.~
@1794 = ~Fade, you're not over-analysing things again, are you?~
@1795 = ~There seem to be all these unwritten rules to it, but no guidelines to what those rules actually are.~
@1796 = ~What are you getting at?~
@1797 = ~Well, I suppose the main guideline is, if it makes both of you feel good, and you're not hurting anyone else, why not?~
@1798 = ~Fade, no one knows what those rules are. We all have to find out the hard way. We don't seem to be doing too bad for a couple of rank amateurs, though.~
@1799 = ~(laugh) Jester! But there again, that's one of main things I love about you; you make me laugh.~
@1800 = ~But that's not what I meant. What I meant is that there seem to be all these unwritten rules to it, but no guidelines to what those rules actually are.~
@1801 = ~Yes, I know... I'm doing it again. But I can't help it. Everything I'm experiencing at the moment... it's all so new to me. I've literally *never* felt like this before. I'm still waiting to wake up, and to find out that none of this has happened, that it was all a dream. Everything is just so... different now.~
@1802 = ~Different? What do you mean by that?~
@1803 = ~I know, it can be a bit daunting sometimes. But you just have to go with the flow. There's no point in dissecting everything in the hope it'll miraculously make sense.~
@1804 = ~(pinch her very lightly) See? Not a dream.~
@1805 = ~We're all experiencing new things all the time, Fade. Just think of this along the same lines, and you'll be fine.~
@1806 = ~(shrug) Well, before we admitted our feelings, we were just friends, and that followed a different set of rules. Now things have changed quite a lot.~
@1807 = ~I used to hide my feelings for you, for fear that you wouldn't want me, that you wouldn't feel the same way. Now I can shout my feelings from the top of the highest peak, if I wanted to! It's a... strange feeling, <CHARNAME>.~
@1808 = ~I know, but it's not just you. I'm having exactly the same feelings, Fade. It's completely natural.~
@1809 = ~You feared that I wouldn't want you? What isn't there to want? (lean in a little closer to her)~
@1810 = ~So just go with your gut instinct, is that what you're saying? But what happens if you have a... conflict, within yourself? What if you don't honestly know what's right?~
@1811 = ~Fade, you're over-analyzing things again. Just relax!~
@1812 = ~What exactly are you getting at, my love?~
@1813 = ~Look, I'll show you what's right, okay?  (kiss her gently)~
@1814 = ~You have a conflict? What do you mean by that?~
@1815 = ~(grin) I suppose you're right there. Listen to me! You'd think that we were the only two people to ever have fallen in love.~
@1816 = ~But I feel like I'm tied up in knots here... so many conflicting emotions. I don't understand it, <CHARNAME>. I try to let things take their natural course, but what if I end up doing something wrong?~
@1817 = ~Then I'll have to show you what's right, won't I?  (kiss her gently)~
@1818 = ~Well, you're not doing anything wrong at the moment, are you? And if you do, I'll be here to help steer you right. This is a partnership, Fade. We will enjoy the good times and work through the bad times together. It's what it's all about.~
@1819 = ~(She giggles in an oddly endearing way as you pinch her) Okay, I get your point. You're about as real as they get.~
@1820 = ~I could get realer, you know... (lean in a little closer to her)~
@1821 = ~(say nothing else, just kiss her gently)~
@1822 = ~And I'm not going anywhere. As long as we keep communicating, we'll be fine.~
@1823 = ~I know, but those experiences really only refer to me--if I make a mistake, I'm only hurting myself. Where you are concerned, I'm more likely to hurt you, and I don't want to do that.~
@1824 = ~And if I like being hurt?~
@1825 = ~Fade, stop worrying. (kiss her gently)~
@1826 = ~Fade, that won't happen. As long as we keep communicating, we'll be fine.~
@1827 = ~(She smiles and kisses your cheek) I really don't deserve you, you know.~
@1828 = ~Yes you do. You deserve all of me. (lean in close to her)~
@1829 = ~(smirk) You really are quite terrible, you know that? (She leans in and kisses you)~
@1830 = ~(kiss her back enthusiastically and allow your hand to travel across her belly)~
@1831 = ~(kiss her back enthusiastically and allow your hand to travel across her buttocks)~
@1832 = ~(kiss her back and hold her tightly to you)~
@1833 = ~(You feel her lips curl into a smile as she accepts your kiss)~
@1834 = ~It's... nothing. Just something I have to work out on my own.~
@1835 = ~Fade, I'm here to help you work through these things. Please tell me what's bothering you. I promise, whatever it is, I won't laugh, or be shocked. I just need to know.~
@1836 = ~(She smiles and kisses you on the cheek) You're absolutely right, <CHARNAME>... as usual! I really don't deserve you, you know.~
@1837 = ~Yes, you're right. Communication is the key.~
@1838 = ~Fade, please tell me what's bothering you. I promise, whatever it is, I won't laugh, or be shocked. I just need to know.~
@1839 = ~Fade, stop worrying. (kiss her gently)~
@1840 = ~(As you reach her thighs, she stiffens slightly, and then pulls away from you, a worried look on her face) <CHARNAME>... ~
@1841 = ~What's wrong?~
@1842 = ~Fade, don't you want me to do that? Don't you want... me? Is that what this is all about?~
@1843 = ~Oh, I'm... sorry. I didn't mean to do that.~
@1844 = ~(As you continue to kiss, you feel yourself begin to respond naturally to her close proximity... and it seems she notices too. With a slightly worried look, she pulls away from you) <CHARNAME>... ~
@1845 = ~I'm sorry. I can't, you know, help that! What's wrong?~
@1846 = ~Oh, I'm... sorry. I... I can't help it.~
@1847 = ~Possibly not the best of times for that to happen, but... what's wrong? Don't you want me to do that? Don't you want... me? Is that what this is all about?~
@1848 = ~(sigh) Okay, this may be difficult for you to understand, but... now we're together, there is going to be a time when... when... ~
@1849 = ~When... what?~
@1850 = ~Oh, I see. When we are going to be... intimate. Well, only if you want to. Do you?~
@1851 = ~Fade, I know what you're getting at, and I know you've had a difficult time with men in the past. I wouldn't push you into anything.~
@1852 = ~(sigh) Nothing is "wrong" <CHARNAME>, at least not with you. The problem lies with me. I'm sorry. I... I am having trouble in... reconciling myself. I get so confused! I love you, and so I want to protect you, to... keep you safe.~
@1853 = ~I will admit, it is the same way I felt about Keita. But I never wanted to be... intimate with Keita. I've never loved any of my playmates, <CHARNAME>, ever. Sex was at best a pleasant distraction, at worst an act forced upon me. In my mind, the physical and the emotional are so far divorced. I don't think I can ever resolve them.~
@1854 = ~I... I don't want you to be just another notch upon my bedpost, <CHARNAME>. You're too special to me.~
@1855 = ~Well, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't surprised, Fade. I've never thought about this like that before. But I respect how you feel, and I shouldn't have tried it on. I'll wait until you are ready.~
@1856 = ~Fade, I'm sorry. I know you've had a difficult time with men in the past, and I should have been a little more sensitive, but let's just say that the "big" head wasn't doing all the thinking.~
@1857 = ~But Fade, I wouldn't have thought this would have bothered you! I mean, it's not like you haven't been round the block a few times already.~
@1858 = ~Kind of. I *do* want you, <CHARNAME>, it's just that... I... I am having trouble in... reconciling myself. I get so confused! I love you, and so I want to protect you, to…keep you safe.~
@1859 = ~Ironically, if you had approached me before my feelings had grown, I wouldn't have had a problem, quite the opposite. Now, however, I... I don't want you to be just another notch upon my bedpost, <CHARNAME>. You're too special to me.~
@1860 = ~It's okay, <CHARNAME>. It's only natural. The problem lies with me. I'm the one who should be sorry. I... I am having trouble in... reconciling myself. I get so confused! I love you, and so I want to protect you, to... keep you safe.~
@1861 = ~When... when we are going to be intimate. And there lies the problem. I... I am having trouble in... reconciling myself. I get so confused! I love you, and so I want to protect you, to... keep you safe.~
@1862 = ~Fade, I'm sorry. I know you've had a difficult time with men in the past, and I should have been a little more…sensitive.~
@1863 = ~I don't think you'd have to "push" me into anything, <CHARNAME>. I'm not unwilling, just confused. I love you, and so I want to protect you, to... keep you safe.~
@1864 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. (She leans into you again and hugs you close) I love you. You're so much more than I deserve.~
@1865 = ~(She chuckles and shakes her head) That's okay... and thank you. (She leans into you again and hugs you close) I love you. You're so much more than I deserve.~
@1866 = ~And so what? That I don't have the right to be sure that I want to sleep with you? Once a whore, always a whore?~
@1867 = ~No! No, that's not what I meant! I'm sorry. I know you've had a difficult time with men in the past, and I should be a little more sensitive, but let's just say that the "big" head isn't doing all the thinking at the moment.~
@1868 = ~That's not what I meant, Fade. I just wouldn't have thought this would have bothered you so much.~
@1869 = ~Well, you're always teasing me.~
@1870 = ~Well, it does. I want to be sure, <CHARNAME>. I love you... (sigh)... but I don't always understand you. No matter. I'll work it out.~
@1871 = ~I know I do. I suppose it's in my nature. To be honest, I don't mean anything by it. (grin) If it *did* mean anything, you would know! So what are you saying? That you want me to stop teasing you?~
@1872 = ~No, of course not. It's funny, although I'll admit I don't like it when you do it to other people! I want to keep you all to myself. (wrap her in a hug)~
@1873 = ~No, you know I don't. I love the way you tease me. But I'm sorry. I know you've had a difficult time with men in the past, and I should be a little more sensitive, but let's just say that the "big" head isn't doing all the thinking at the moment.~
@1874 = ~Well, unless you mean it, yes. It's not fair, to tease me and not come up with the goods.~
@1875 = ~(She hugs you back) That's alright. I want you to keep me all to yourself too. I love you... you're more than I deserve.~

You begin to wonder if her lashing tail could be a signal of another tension entirely... )~
@1884 = ~(wrap your arms around her and kiss her back just as fiercely)~
@1885 = ~(hold her at arm's length) Whoa! I take it you've sorted out your little problem, then?~
@1886 = ~(disentangle yourself from her) Okay, I think I know what this is all about, and I'm not really interested, all right?~
@1887 = ~(She raises a crimson eyebrow and grins wolfishly) Here? I don't think you'd want an audience... unless that's the kind of thing you're really into. Come on! (She grabs you by the front of your tunic and drags you off behind her)~
@1888 = ~(She pulls away from your kiss, breathing heavily, and runs her tongue along her teeth) I think you know why I've brought you here, <CHARNAME>. (Her voice has a rough, husky edge to it, and she runs a finger down the front of your tunic and across your chest. She leans in closer to whisper in your ear; her breath is sweet on your cheek)~
@1889 = ~I want you. I want to feel you near me, your skin next to mine. I want to taste you, to explore you, to feel you inside me.~
@1890 = ~(She begins to unlace your tunic so she can feel your bare flesh under her fingers) I want to hear you scream, <CHARNAME>. I want to worship you.~
@1891 = ~(say nothing and let her continue)~
@1892 = ~(whisper) I... I haven't done this before, Fade. I don't know what you want me to do... ~
@1893 = ~(pull away from her) No, Fade. I know I said I loved you, but I've been having second thoughts. This isn't a good idea. I'm sorry, but I can't bring myself to do this. Not with you.~
@1894 = ~I suppose you could say that... ~
@1895 = ~(She pulls you closer again, breathing heavily, and runs her tongue along her teeth) You know why I've brought you here, <CHARNAME>. (Her voice has a rough, husky edge to it, and she runs a finger down the front of your tunic and across your chest. She leans in closer to whisper in your ear; her breath is sweet on your cheek)~
@1896 = ~You're... not interested? I want you, here, <CHARNAME>... now. After what we spoke of last time... do... do you not love me anymore?~
@1897 = ~It's actually what you said that got me thinking, Fade. I do love you, I'm just not ready to love you like that yet. Too much is going on. I'm sorry.~
@1898 = ~I've been thinking much on that, Fade, and no, I don't. It's really the idea of loving you that I fell in love with--you're so unusual. I'm sorry.~
@1899 = ~(She tries to smile back, but her disappointment is plain. She sighs and nods in assent, and then lets you go)~
@1900 = ~(smile) I'll take that as a yes, then... ~
@1901 = ~(She guides you to the ground, and then stands over you. Slowly, almost teasingly, she removes her clothes, until she is clad in nothing more than her tattoos. She is lightly muscled, and again you notice that she is rather more curvaceous than other elves you have met)~
@1902 = ~(She runs her hands down the side of her body, and quirks a single eyebrow at you) Well, what do you think? Do I meet with your... approval?~
@1903 = ~Truly? Well... I'll have to be gentle and teach you then, won't I?~
@1904 = ~(She pulls you close to her and kisses you softly, softer than you would imagine Fade capable of. She then guides you to the ground, and then stands over you. Slowly, almost teasingly, she removes her clothes, until she is clad in nothing more than her tattoos. She is lightly muscled, and again you notice that she is rather more curvaceous than other elves you have met)~
@1905 = ~Unusual? You thought me unusual, nothing more? So once again I am destined to be an oddity, an exotic, there for the pleasure of all? I'm glad you told me this, <CHARNAME>, for now I see you are no different from everyone else who has tried to use me! And I will NOT be used again!~
@1906 = ~(She glares at you, her eyes flashing wildly, and then storms off. After a few steps, she stops)~
@1907 = ~Oh, and, <CHARNAME>, with an attitude like that, you'd better get pretty friendly with your hands... unless you have gold to spare, of course!~
@1908 = ~(Actions speak louder than words, so, without bothering to reply, you simply reach up and pull her down beside you. Fade smiles rather wickedly, crimson eyes dancing) So eager, <CHARNAME>? Then let us begin... ~

//LT52
@1909 = ~So, you're awake. (She smiles contentedly, nestles herself against your shoulder, and traces a finger down your chest)~
@1910 = ~(hold her close and just enjoy the moment)~
@1911 = ~So, how do you feel?~
@1912 = ~(grin) I most certainly am.~
@1913 = ~(After a while, Fade sighs and rolls onto her back) I have to say this, <CHARNAME>, being with you is definitely... different. It was... I don't know, somehow less selfish than I'm used to.~
@1914 = ~What do you mean by that? If you prefer selfish, I can always do that.~
@1915 = ~Fade, it isn't supposed to be selfish. It's supposed to be an expression of our feelings for each other. I hope you realize that.~
@1916 = ~That's because this is love, Fade, not some casual fling. I want to please you, to show you how much I love you, not just gratify myself.~
@1917 = ~(She sighs and rolls onto her back) Feel? I feel... very contented, <CHARNAME>. Being with you is definitely... different. It was... I don't know, somehow less selfish than I'm used to.~
@1918 = ~(grin) I can see that, <CHARNAME>. (She sighs and rolls onto her back) I have to say this, <CHARNAME>, being with you is definitely... different. It was... I don't know, somehow less selfish than I'm used to.~
@1919 = ~No, that's not what I meant at all. I mean... I prefer it this way. I prefer it with you. It didn't feel like merely, well, scratching an itch, it meant something to me. And although I will admit that thought makes me feel a little vulnerable, I... I just never knew that's what it was supposed to be like.~
@1920 = ~It made you feel vulnerable? I suppose it can do that. That's because this is love, Fade, not some casual fling. I want to please you, to show you how much I love you, not just gratify myself.~
@1921 = ~(grin) So, do you want to start over again, before the others wake up?~
@1922 = ~I do now, <CHARNAME>. I suppose I was just worried that... that this would be just another thing you would do to me, and then that would be it--thank you, here's a few coppers for your time. I know that's a dreadful thing to think, but it's what I'm used to.~
@1923 = ~But now I know different. I prefer it this way. I prefer it with you. It didn't feel like merely, well, scratching an itch, it meant something to me. And although I will admit that thought makes me feel a little vulnerable, I... I just never knew that's what it was supposed to be like.~
@1924 = ~Well, I certainly feel loved! (Her smile turns a little crafty) Although there's nothing *wrong* with gratification, per se... ~
@1925 = ~You aren't wrong there. So, do you want to start over again, before the others wake up?~
@1926 = ~You minx! Come on, as much as I'd like to lie here all day, we really should get up now.~
@1927 = ~(grin) I thought you'd never ask... ~
@1928 = ~(She props herself up beside you and traces a finger along your jaw) Getting up already? Sure I can't... change your mind?~
@1929 = ~Not that I'm not tempted, but we do have much to do. We have to go.~
@1930 = ~Ooh, you little temptress... (pull her closer to you)~
@1931 = ~Yes, you're right. (grin) But later on, you're all mine, okay?~
@1932 = ~(grin) I try my best, <CHARNAME>... ~

@1933 = ~Why do you constantly bombard him with questions? Can't you see he doesn't have any interest in you?~
@1934 = ~Pardon?~
@1935 = ~<CHARNAME> is... is a good man, Fade. He doesn't need the likes of you.~
@1936 = ~And exactly who are you to make this judgement, little fancy?~
@1937 = ~I... I just think you should stay away, thief!~
@1938 = ~Ahhh... protecting <CHARNAME>'s virtue, are we Aerie? Or hoping he'll steal yours?~
@1939 = ~Don't be so disgusting!~
@1940 = ~But I'm right, aren't I?~
@1941 = ~<CHARNAME>... please make her go away!~
@1942 = ~Fade, leave Aerie alone, period. She's only looking out for me.~
@1943 = ~I'll do nothing of the sort, Aerie. I happen to like Fade.~
@1944 = ~Whatever you want. I didn't think simpering little girls were your thing, but obviously I was wrong.~
@1945 = ~You... *like* her? Well, I'll leave you both to it, then!~
@1946 = ~Now that's over, can I ask you something <CHARNAME>?~

@1947 = ~(sigh) Again the fiendling speaks as if <CHARNAME> is in any shape or form interested in her. I don't know why I don't just banish you back to the Abyss, jalil.~
@1948 = ~I don't come from the Abyss, Viconia. And I am only answering a question <CHARNAME> posed to me last we spoke.~
@1949 = ~No doubt through some misguided notion of politeness on his behalf, I am sure. And you say you don't come from the Abyss? (sniff) Well, you certainly smell as if you do... ~
@1950 = ~You bitch!~
@1951 = ~Ahhh... the last response of the intellectually challenged.~
@1952 = ~Fade, ignore her. She's just trying to get a reaction out of you. You were about to tell me of your upbringing? Go on.~
@1953 = ~Although there's no reason to be quite so insulting, Viconia is right. My interest in your upbringing has waned.~

@1954 = ~Apologising *again*, fiendling? My, my. Those knees of yours must be rubbed raw.~
@1955 = ~(growl) Shut up, drow.~
@1956 = ~I have told you before--do not speak to your betters in such a way, or I *will* have your tongue ripped from your mouth.~
@1957 = ~Really? I'd like to see you try!~
@1958 = ~So unstable... really, <CHARNAME>, why you would allow *that* anywhere near you is beyond me.~
@1959 = ~Oh, and I suppose you have far more to offer?~
@1960 = ~(laugh) You know I do, iblith.~
@1961 = ~And so do I. Sorry, Fade, but Viconia does have a point.~
@1962 = ~Viconia, if you think for one second I am interested in you, you're sadly mistaken. Now, Fade, what were you saying?~
@1963 = ~Oh, shut it, the pair of you. I've had enough. I'm not interested in either of you, okay?~
@1964 = ~Fine, I'll leave you both to it. Just don't come crying to me when it all inevitably goes wrong.~
@1965 = ~Whatever. I don't know why I even bothered.~
@1966 = ~So, you are nothing more than a weak male. I'm glad I found out now!~
@1967 = ~Only... only that I have to apologise for how I spoke to you last. I lost my temper, and that was wrong.~

@1968 = ~Of course he's tired! But I do not believe for one second that you are concerned about his welfare, succubus.~
@1969 = ~Although you may this hard to believe, I *am* concerned about <CHARNAME>'s welfare. That role is not yours alone.~
@1970 = ~Role? I don't know what you're talking about.~
@1971 = ~Oh please, Jaheira. I see the possessive little glances, the constant disdain of any other female company... it's pathetic.~
@1972 = ~Pathetic, you say? No more pathetic than your constant posturing and approval seeking, thief!~
@1973 = ~Oh, go and chew on a tree, Jaheira!~
@1974 = ~Fade, I will not allow you to speak to Jaheira like that! There is no need for it. Apologise to Jaheira!~
@1975 = ~Jaheira, Fade was only asking a question. Why won't you cut her some slack?~
@1976 = ~Oh, for the love of... pack it in, you two! Or at least bicker elsewhere!~
@1977 = ~Apologise? Not likely! Am I not allowed to ask you a simple question without running it past Little Miss Balance now? I didn't realize she was your keeper!~
@1978 = ~Not when you insult her, no! I will not tolerate it.~
@1979 = ~Of course she's not! I don't know where she gets the idea that she might be. What did you want to ask?~
@1980 = ~I am only concerned for you, <CHARNAME>. I do not know why that little viper is interested in you.~
@1981 = ~Not that it is any business of yours in the first place!~
@1982 = ~Will you allow me to speak! I... I am worried that her intentions are less than noble... ~
@1983 = ~I think it is up to me as to whether I want to find out how noble Fade's intentions are, don't you, Jaheira? Now, what did you want to ask, Fade?~
@1984 = ~Jaheira, why the concern? There's nothing for you to be worried about. I have no interest in Fade.~
@1985 = ~Fine. I only wanted to ask you a simple question, because no matter what *she* thinks, I am concerned about you. But I see you only value her opinion, so I shall take my leave.~
@1986 = ~You... don't?~
@1987 = ~No, he does not! And it is nothing, <CHARNAME>... I am just looking out for you.~
@1988 = ~I... see. Well, I shall leave you both to it, then!~
@1989 = ~Only if you're alright. You seem to be very tired.~

@1990 = ~(You decide to take time out to relax and have a drink, something none of you normally have time for. Fade decides to grasp this opportunity with both hands and ends up drinking more than is possibly wise)~
@1991 = ~(After spending the last half hour watching her standing on a table singing bawdy songs with an even more inebriated group of dwarves she seems to have befriended, you marvel at her apparent ability to be at home in almost any company, even though she is technically an Outsider)~
@1992 = ~(She soon notices you watching her, however, and grinning rather stupidly at you, she wends her way over to you, a mug of ale in one hand, and deposits herself in your lap, flinging her arms around your neck) 'Ello <CHARNAME>... ~
@1993 = ~Hello, Fade. Don't you think you've had enough?~
@1994 = ~Hello, Fade. I see you're having fun. (wrap your arms around her waist)~
@1995 = ~Get off me, you drunken fool. Go and pester someone else.~
@1996 = ~(Her grin widens and she shakes her head) I have only jusht starteded *hic* 'scuse me... Come on, <CHARNAME>! Join me innalittledrinkie... it's good for what ails youse.~
@1997 = ~OI! BARKEEP! A little drinkie here for my mostest esteemeded an' gorgeoustest boyfriend here.~
@1998 = ~Okay, I'll have a drink with you. But you must promise then that you'll slow down. You'll only regret it in the morning.~
@1999 = ~(grin) Most esteemed and gorgeous boyfriend, eh?~
@2000 = ~No, Fade. I don't really drink and I really think you've had enough. Come on, give me that mug.~
@2001 = ~(She nods her head enthusiastically) Them dwarvseses know how to drink! Theys bin buyin' me this. (She thrusts her mug of ale under your nose--it smells strong. She taps the side of her nose conspiratorially, missing it a few times)~
@2002 = ~Between you an' me I think that it tashtes like cat piss, but youcan'tberude to the dwarvseseses. Theys very proud of their catsh piss. *hic* I mean alesh. You wanna wanna drink?~
@2003 = ~(sigh) Okay, Fade, I'll have a drink with you. Just slow down, all right? Otherwise you're totally going to regret this in the morning.~
@2004 = ~No, Fade, please stop drinking now. I don't really drink, so I really don't want one, and I think you've had enough now. Give me that mug.~
@2005 = ~Oooooooooooh! 'm a drunkenen fool, am I? Well, I'm sure that pretty beer wench over there or that rather deliciousus bardbloke will appreciate my *hic* drunkenen foolness!~
@2006 = ~(She strikes a pose, one finger in the air) But firstly! 'm goin' t'go an' get anotherlittledrinkie! (She gets up off your lap and wobbles away from you)~
@2007 = ~Wha'? Mornin'? Oh, sod th'mornin'. Live life for the now, <CHARNAME>!~
@2008 = ~(The barkeep sends over a serving girl to your table. Fade leans back in your lap to get a good look at her. The serving girl smiles rather wearily at the two of you and asks you what you want. Fade grins at the girl in an alarmingly seductive manner) You're ver' pretty, y'know. I bets you gots thighs as soft as silk, haven't you... ~
@2009 = ~Fade!! There really is no need for that! (to the serving girl) Please ignore my friend. She really has no head for ale, and she didn't mean it, I'm sure.~
@2010 = ~(try to put your hand over Fade's mouth to shut her up) Please, just ignore her. I'll have a glass of wine, thank you.~
@2011 = ~(try to stifle a laugh) Fade! You can't speak to people like that, it's not very nice. (to the serving girl) I'll have whatever it is she's drinking.~
@2012 = ~(She giggles and covers her mouth with her hand, a rather endearingly girlish gesture) I can pay y'a complimenent if I wants to, <CHARNAME>. (She leans forward in your lap, wraps her arms around your neck and rests her head on your shoulder)~
@2013 = ~(After a short while, the barkeep sends over a serving girl, who smiles rather wearily at you both and asks you what you want. At this, Fade looks up at her) I'll be havin' of more of your lovelely ale.~
@2014 = ~(She leans closer to the serving girl, and mock-whispers at her) You're ver' pretty, y'know. But no matterer how pretty y'are, y' canna be havin' this one. (She leans forward again and clasps you to her breast) 'cos this one's mine!~
@2015 = ~(snuggle up against her cleavage with a self satisfied smile) I'll have what ever she's drinking.~
@2016 = ~(disentangle yourself from her) No, I'm not yours, Fade, not while you're drunk. Other times, maybe, but not now. I'm going to bed.~
@2017 = ~Suit y'self! But 'm goin' t'go an' get anotherlittledrinkie! (She gets up off your lap and wobbles away from you)~
@2018 = ~(She leaps up from your lap, holding the mug out of your reach) You want it? Come an' get it!~
@2019 = ~(She pokes her tongue out at you, and with a flick of her tail, runs back off to her new dwarven friends. You hear them cheer when she rejoins them, and decide that, even after all you've been through, you really don't want to face a group of drunken dwarves with an inebriated Fey'ri in tow!)~
@2020 = ~(She covers her mouth with her hand and tries to stifle a giggle) Oh, I'm a baaaad girl! I'm in troububble now... (the serving girl just shakes her head and leaves)~
@2021 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... jus' lightenen up a bit. (She takes a gulp from her mug) Thas' th'problem withpeoplelikeyou... don't know when 'm jokin' an' when 'm bein' sheriousus. 'm not jus' a pair of fantastictitsonlegsh, y'know... ~
@2022 = ~WHAT? Where did that one come from? What are you talking about?~
@2023 = ~(sigh) Whatever, Fade, whatever. I definitely think you've had enough of that now. (try to pluck the drink from her hand)~
@2024 = ~(As you place your hand over her mouth, you feel her grin, and as you are speaking, you feel her start licking and nibbling the inside of your hand. The serving girl just nods and leaves to get your order)~
@2025 = ~Ewww! Fade, don't do that. It's disgusting. I really do think you've had enough of that. (try to grab her ale mug)~
@2026 = ~(pull her closer to you) If you're going to do things like that, don't do them to my hand... ~
@2027 = ~(remove your hand from her mouth) Come on, Fade, stop messing around. I think it's time you said goodnight to all the nice people here and went to bed.~
@2028 = ~(Fade waggles her eyebrows suggestively at you and then wraps her arms around your neck) Am I a bad girl then, <CHARNAME>?~
@2029 = ~Oh yes, Fade. Very bad. In fact, I feel punishment may be in order... (lean forward and kiss her)~
@2030 = ~(disentangle yourself from her) Yes, you are, and I think you've had enough by now. I think you should go and say goodnight to all your new friends and go to bed, okay?~
@2031 = ~(She looks down at you and grins) You like it there? Wouldn'n't it betterer here? (She places her fingers under your chin to tilt your head up to her face)~
@2032 = ~Possibly... (lean forward and allow her to kiss you)~
@2033 = ~(disentangle yourself from her) Maybe, but I think you've had enough now and I think you should go and say goodnight to all your new friends and go to bed, okay?~
@2034 = ~(She leans back in your lap so her back is against the table and rests her ankles on your shoulders) It's jus' that peoples see that'm a part succubus an' they asss... asus... amus... think tha'm nothin' more'n a play thing for theirownpleasure.~
@2035 = ~(She sticks her finger in her ale and begins to play with the foam. After a few seconds, she with draws her finger and puts it in her mouth, seemingly oblivious to how suggestive this may seem to onlookers)~
@2036 = ~Fade, you're not doing much to counteract that image at the moment. Maybe you should just go and say goodnight to all the nice people and go to bed.~
@2037 = ~(She responds hungrily, and you feel her tail wrap itself around your leg. She shifts slightly forwards so that her entire body is pressed against yours. After a while your hear a drunken dwarven voice shout "Get a room, you two!" and lots of hearty laughter)~
@2038 = ~Want to take their advice?~
@2039 = ~(ignore them and continue to kiss her)~
@2040 = ~(After a while, you realize that she is flagging--her alcohol consumption is obviously catching up with her. As you break apart, she tries to stifle a yawn)~
@2041 = ~Come on. Maybe you should go to bed now.~
@2042 = ~(She gives you a slightly sly look and nods. You are almost suspicious at her compliance, but she stands up, bows and wishes everyone a rather slurred goodnight. Many of the patrons bid her goodnight back, and the dwarves begin to whoop, calling her "lightweight". She just grins at them, and takes you by the hand)~
@2043 = ~Okay then. But you're goin' to havta help me... ~
@2044 = ~No, Fade, you can find your own way up to bed. I'm not tired now. Go on.~
@2045 = ~Okay.~
@2046 = ~You push her in the direction of the stairs, and despite her sleepy protestations, she eventually begins to stumble her way up them. You decide to just leave her be.~
@2047 = ~(She nods and takes your hand)~
@2048 = ~(You get to your room, and as you fumble with the key, Fade begins to kiss the back of your neck, distracting you somewhat from the task at hand. Eventually you get the key turned in the lock, and both fall into the room together, Fade giggling as she lands on top of you)~
@2049 = ~(You both get up and stagger over to the bed, Fade because she is drunk, you because you are bearing most of her weight. She continues to kiss you for a while, and teases you by nibbling your shoulders and running her hand up your inner thigh)~
@2050 = ~(let her continue)~
@2051 = ~Fade, you're drunk. I'm not about to take advantage of that. Just lie down and rest.~
@2052 = ~(You end up in a mini wrestling match, and the drunk Fey'ri is no match for you. She just spends the entire time trying alternately to kiss and tickle you. As you begin to unlace her tunic, she yawns hugely, and her eyes begin to droop--you know that no matter what you do, she is going to fall into a trance)~
@2053 = ~(Shaking your head in amusement and, you have to admit to yourself, slight disappointment, you cover her up and crawl in beside her. She fidgets slightly, trying to get comfortable, and pulls your arm around her waist, so you are cuddled up against her back. You then close your eyes and decide now would be a good time to get some rest any way)~
@2054 = ~(She lies back on the bed in what could be considered a rather seductive pose, if her eyelids did not keep drooping closed. After a few seconds of struggling to remain awake, she finally gives in to her urge to trance)~

@2055 = ~(Fade shivers and looks around her a little apprehensively)~
@2056 = ~Are you all right... Mistress?~
@2057 = ~(ignore her)~
@2058 = ~(She nods, but does not smile) I am reminded too much of many things I do not wish to remember, here. This place reeks of the Abyss, of despair, of hatred and of greed. But I am fine.~
@2059 = ~(whisper) As long as you are sure. Just don't blow our cover, okay?~
@2060 = ~(whisper) What do you mean?~
@2061 = ~(whisper) Fade, I'm warning you, no silly outbursts. Just do as you're told for once. I cannot afford for our ruse to be uncovered. Do I make myself clear?~
@2062 = ~Come here... male. I need to speak with you.~
@2063 = ~Are you alright... Mistress?~
@2064 = ~Male? Who the hell are you calling "male"?~
@2065 = ~You presume to tell me how to behave in a place such as this?~
@2066 = ~(quietly) And I thought you trusted me. I will not betray you, Veldrin, by deed or by comment. It would mean both our deaths.~
@2067 = ~(whisper) I didn't mean to admonish you, Fade. It's just that you can get a bit, well, passionate about things you don't like. But you're right. I do trust you, and I know you won't betray our secret. Come on, we have much to do here.~
@2068 = ~(whisper) Exactly. That's why I need you to behave yourself. No silly outbursts; just do as you're told for once. I cannot afford for our ruse to be uncovered. Do I make myself clear?~
@2069 = ~(whisper) What do you mean about behaving in a place like this?~
@2070 = ~Not here. Order a room, where we can speak in private, away from watchful eyes and ears.~
@2071 = ~(She looks away from you, giving all the drow in the tavern an imperious, defiant look, as if daring them to comment)~
@2072 = ~I shall do that, Mistress.~
@2073 = ~But Mistress, maybe it would be better to tell me now, if it is so important... ~
@2074 = ~Perfectly. (She raises her voice slightly) Now get out of my sight.~
@2075 = ~(She glares at you, and you have no choice but to obey)~
@2076 = ~(hiss) Remember where we are! (loudly) Do as I say, male!~
@2077 = ~Yes... Mistress. (quietly) Are you alright?~
@2078 = ~I really need to speak with you, Veldrin. Order a room, where we can speak in private, away from watchful eyes and ears.~
@2079 = ~You dare question me? Then it is unimportant. (She raises her voice slightly) Now get out of my sight.~

@2080 = ~(When you enter the room, she quickly locks the door behind you, and then listens closely, obviously worried someone will be listening)~
@2081 = ~Fade, is that entirely necessary? I don't think anyone will disturb us.~
@2082 = ~So, what did you mean earlier?~
@2083 = ~I'm afraid it is. The drow are not unlike the Fey'ri... and the Fey'ri are a traitorous, paranoid lot. If any of the drow here suspects anything, anything at all, and they think it will benefit their house... (sigh) We are in real danger here, <CHARNAME>.~
@2084 = ~Thanks for pointing out the obvious, Fade. I had no idea. Now what did you mean earlier?~
@2085 = ~I know. The sooner we are out of here, the better, but we have to play along, just until we get the eggs. What did you mean earlier?~
@2086 = ~(She sits down on the bed, and you sit next to her) Once upon a time I would have relished being here. I might even have been tolerated... the Fey'ri and the drow have been known to co-operate in the past. Well, maybe not co-operate. I don't think that's a word either race totally understands. We would *use* each other.~
@2087 = ~(She picks absent-mindedly at the fringe of the blanket covering the bed) You know, neither the Fey'ri nor the drow have a word for "alliance". The nearest word in Abyssal loosely translates as "conspiracy", or "requirement".~
@2088 = ~It's the same with the drow. At least they have a word that roughly translates as "friend". We don't even have one of those. We have mate, supplicant, superior, inferior, slave... ~
@2089 = ~This place... it's too much like the Citadel. Its atmosphere, its inhabitants... the haughty, empty and cruel cast of that drow female's eyes... the hopeless, impotent anger in the male... it's all so familiar to me. Cruelty and gratification for their own sake... ~
@2090 = ~It's almost too much to bear! The temptation to raise the whip... to command... to lose oneself in the frenzy of physicality in whatever guise you seek it... I do not wish to go there again!~
@2091 = ~But my blood rebels... the fiendish side of me sits up and begs to be let loose here, even in this drow disguise. But to do that would be to lose myself again... to forget... to dishonour... ~
@2092 = ~You must help me, <CHARNAME>! I cannot lose myself... ~
@2093 = ~(wrap her in a hug) I will not allow it to happen, Fade. Together we will fight, okay? Be strong.~
@2094 = ~(wrap her in a hug) I didn't realise... I thought such a place would disgust you, but I guess I understand. You have to be strong, for both our sakes. I will try to help you in whatever way I can.~
@2095 = ~What are you on about, Fade?! You're tempted by this place? You're crazy, did you know that? Absolutely crazy! I should have left you back in Athkatla, with your Shadow Thief cronies. Just stay away from me from now on, okay?~
@2096 = ~Who said you would lose yourself? You gave up your heritage... maybe your blood is willing you to reclaim it. You should be proud of what you are, Fade, and embrace your more... demonic qualities. I can see you want to... I can see the fire there, in your eyes. (whisper) You can use me... ~
@2097 = ~(As you speak, she begins to caress the back of your neck, and then nibbles your shoulder, swinging one leg over you so she is sitting in your lap. Her intention is obvious)~
@2098 = ~(push her off roughly) Fade, what the hell are you playing at?!?~
@2099 = ~(disentangle yourself from her) Fade, no. This isn't you. Please? Not as drow. We'll only regret it.~
@2100 = ~(allow her to carry on)~
@2101 = ~(You storm out of the room, and the last thing you see before the door swings shut is the look of mingled pain, shock and despair on Fade's face)~
@2102 = ~(Her eyes darken, and she roughly pushes you back on the bed and straddles you, trapping your arms under her knees. She then pulls out a dagger and leans over you, running the dagger's blade slowly down your tunic, cutting through the laces)~
@2103 = ~(As your eyes meet hers, her former lustful visage is replaced by one of horror, and she sits up abruptly with a cry, releasing your arms, and flings the dagger away from her) No! I will NOT give in!~
@2104 = ~(scramble away from her) Are you crazy? Give in? What in the Nine Hells were you going to do then? I just thought that... that... ~
@2105 = ~(grab her wrists) Come on, Fade. You know you want to.~
@2106 = ~(Her eyes flare with momentary anger, and you wonder if she will attack you there and then for denying her. She then shakes her head, and when she speaks, her voice is dismayed and desperate)~
@2107 = ~I can't help it, <CHARNAME >! I'm sorry... This is why you have to help me. It's almost too much for me... I'm trying to resist, but it gnaws at me so... ~
@2108 = ~(She takes a deep breath and closes her eyes) I must be strong. You're right. But I can't do it alone... ~
@2109 = ~I said I'd help you, Fade, and I will. I'm sorry I pushed you. I didn't realise that your... compulsion was so strong. We'll stay here for now, so you can calm down. Everything will be better once you've rested.~
@2110 = ~Well, you're going to have to! You're crazy, did you know that? Absolutely crazy! I should have left you back in Athkatla, with your Shadow Thief cronies. Just stay away from me from now on, okay?~
@2111 = ~I'll help you, Fade, but I want it made quite plain that I have no intention of ever giving in to you. I don't know what instincts you are acting on at the moment, but I'm not interested, okay?~
@2112 = ~(Her eyes flare with momentary anger at being denied, but is soon replaced by a look of resignation) You're right, <CHARNAME >. (sigh) I probably would have ended up killing you if you let me carry on... I can't help it in this place.~
@2113 = ~I have to be strong, I have to fight it... but I can't do it alone, that much must be obvious to you now. Please, you have to help me.~
@2114 = ~I said I'd help you Fade, and I will. I didn't realise that your... compulsion was so strong. We'll stay here for now, so you can calm down. Everything will be better once you've rested. Trust me.~
@2115 = ~You would have killed me? Why?~
@2116 = ~(She begins to slowly unlace her tunic, but as her eyes meet yours, she stops and shakes her head, looking confused) No... this is wrong... wrong. Not as drow... ~
@2117 = ~What? No! Don't stop now!~
@2118 = ~You're right. Not as drow. We would only end up regretting it. I said I'd help you Fade, and I will. Come on, we'll rest here for now, so we can both calm down. It'll be better once we've rested, I'm sure of it.~
@2119 = ~You thought what? That you'd get a bit of gratification out of me, and that would be it? <CHARNAME >, I'm part succubus! You may not die if I kiss you, but if I let go... if I let that side of me take over... who knows what would happen?~
@2120 = ~This place isn't healthy for me! I don't know whether I want to mate with you or rip you into little bits!~
@2121 = ~You're crazy, did you know that? Absolutely crazy! I should have left you back in Athkatla, with your Shadow Thief cronies. Just stay away from me from now on, okay?~
@2122 = ~Is it that bad? Okay, I'll help you, even if it's just to stop you from ripping my heart out! Come on, we'll rest here for now, so we can both calm down. It'll be better once we've rested, I'm sure of it.~
@2123 = ~No!! You think this will be a simple act of gratification? <CHARNAME >, I'm part succubus! You may not die if I kiss you, but if I let go... if I let that side of me take over... who knows what would happen?~
@2124 = ~What? I didn't... Okay, I'll help you, even if it's just to stop you from ripping my heart out! Come on, we'll rest here for now, so we can both calm down. It'll be better once we've rested, I'm sure of it.~
@2125 = ~(keep hold of her wrists and pull her closer) I don't believe you, Fade.~
@2126 = ~Yes, rest... but keep yourself safe. I want you to promise... if I get out of hand, if I give in and become a danger... you will kill me. I can't live like that again.~
@2127 = ~Of course, Fade. But it will never come to that, trust me. Now rest.~
@2128 = ~Fade, I can't promise that. I can't kill you. I'll compromise, though. If it happens, and only if, I'll knock you out until we get back to the surface, okay? No arguing. Now rest.~
@2129 = ~(A look of dismay crosses her face) Yes, <CHARNAME >... I understand. (She turns away from you and lies on the bed, as if preparing to trance, and says nothing more)~
@2130 = ~(sigh) I'm part succubus, <CHARNAME >. You may not die if I kiss you, but if I let go... if I let that side of me take over... who knows what would happen?~
@2131 = ~This place isn't healthy for me. I don't know whether I want to mate with you or rip you into little bits! I'm possibly not... safe to be around at the moment.~
@2132 = ~(She wrenches her wrists from you and jumps off the bed) No... No! Everything... it's over, <CHARNAME>, possibly even before it began, but it's *over*! I can't believe you want me to become... to allow that side of me to prevail... just for your own pleasure?! Not that you would have been able to have handled me in any way!!~
@2133 = ~(She unlocks the door, wrenches it open and storms off)~

@2134 = ~(As you settle down, Fade sits on the end of your bed, her knees tucked up under her chin) <CHARNAME>, this isn't good.~
@2135 = ~Understatement of the year, Fade.~
@2136 = ~I know.~
@2137 = ~Fade, what are we going to do?~
@2138 = ~I know. (She pauses and seems to stare at the wall for a while) <CHARNAME>, does this predicament frighten you at all? Or is it just me?~
@2139 = ~You're... scared?~
@2140 = ~Yes, it does, and no, it isn't just you. Here we are, in the last place on all of Faerun we want to be... I'm sorry, Fade. I never meant to put you in such danger. I should never have taken you along with me.~
@2141 = ~This predicament worries me, Fade, but we just have to stay strong and work through it. Everything will be alright. It has to be.~
@2142 = ~"I know"? Is that all you're going to say? I don't know about you, <CHARNAME>, but this whole situation... worries me somewhat. Doesn't it worry you?~
@2143 = ~(She looks to you, and with a gentle smile, sits closer to you) We're going to work it out, that's what we're going to do. (She lays a hand on your shoulder) I'm worried too, but we will be okay. We have to be okay.~
@2144 = ~But how can you be so sure? Here we are, in the last place on all of Faerun we want to be... I'm sorry, Fade. I never meant to put you in such danger. I should never have taken you along with me.~
@2145 = ~Yes, you're right. It's just another challenge to face. We'll be fine.~
@2146 = ~Aren't you scared?~
@2147 = ~A bit. It's hard to stay optimistic down here in the dark, knowing that we are in possibly the most dangerous place on all Faerun.~
@2148 = ~(gesture her towards your open arms) Come here.~
@2149 = ~Just try to see it as another challenge to face, and we'll be fine.~
@2150 = ~<CHARNAME>, don't say that. Don't blame yourself--there was nothing you could have done to prevent this situation.~
@2151 = ~(She sits next to you, places an arm around your shoulders and rests her head atop yours) Everything will be okay. You look absolutely shattered. Just... try to rest. I'll stay here and watch for you, just in case.~
@2152 = ~Yes, you're right.~
@2153 = ~I really hope so, <CHARNAME>.~
@2154 = ~(She sits next to you, places an arm around your shoulders and rests her head atop yours) Everything will be okay--it has to be. You look absolutely shattered. Just... try to rest. I'll stay here and watch for you, just in case.~
@2155 = ~<CHARNAME>, don't say that. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else--because I'm with you. Please don't blame yourself. There was nothing you could have done to prevent this situation.~
@2156 = ~(She sits next to you, places an arm around your shoulders, kisses you and rests her head atop yours) Everything will be okay. Now you look absolutely shattered. Just... try to rest. I'll stay here and watch for you, just in case.~
@2157 = ~(She sits next to you, places an arm around your shoulders, kisses you and rests her head atop yours) Everything will be okay, because we are together. Now you look absolutely shattered. Just... try to rest. I'll stay here and watch for you, just in case.~
@2158 = ~(She sits next to you, places an arm around your shoulders, kisses you and rests her head atop yours) Everything will be okay--it has to be. You look absolutely shattered. Just... try to rest. I'll stay here and watch for you, just in case.~
@2159 = ~(She gives you a grateful smile and moves closer to you, nestling her head against your shoulder, wrapping her arms around you) I know everything will be okay--it has to be. You look absolutely shattered. Just... try to rest. I'll stay here and watch for you, just in case.~

@2160 = ~Cernd, has it ever occurred to you that nature can be a cruel mistress?~
@2161 = ~What makes you say that?~
@2162 = ~Well... I look around myself and everywhere I see bloodshed and death. I have always been led to believe that nature was the soft option... but now I'm not so sure.~
@2163 = ~(smile) Nature never takes the "soft option"... and we often learn that the hard way. We expect nature to be benevolent, but she knows the way of things. It's better to serve the balance and make sure what happens benefits all.~

@2164 = ~Fade, are you a planar creature?~
@2165 = ~No, I don't think so. (grin) Creature, maybe, but I hail from around here.~
@2166 = ~It is just that your aura is a trifle... strange. I know of your people, but you are somewhat of an enigma.~
@2167 = ~So it isn't just the tail and the talons, then?~
@2168 = ~No. I am used to those who walk so far from nature's path coming from strange and wondrous places, that is all.~
@2169 = ~I walk outside of nature? What do you mean?~
@2170 = ~Your place in nature's grand scheme is... uncertain.~
@2171 = ~So I'm unnatural?~
@2172 = ~No. (smile) Just different.~

@2173 = ~All the time you speak of the "balance" of things... yet how can you know what balances what?~
@2174 = ~What? Balance is important. To tip one's hand to far, whether in the name of "good" or "evil", will inevitably lead to chaos in nature. This cannot be.~
@2175 = ~But if nature is so powerful, surely she can prevent it herself?~
@2176 = ~Look at yourself, Fade. You are one who walks out of balance, yet you still exist. Nature will encompass you, but she cannot change you or make you walk her path.~
@2177 = ~I'm not sure whether I have just been insulted or not... but I take your point.~

@2178 = ~Jaheira, who was Khalid?~
@2179 = ~You dare speak his name--~
@2180 = ~No, Jaheira, I don't want any hostilities from you. I'm just curious.~
@2181 = ~I am sorry. My... protectiveness of him seems to follow him in death as it did in life. Khalid was... my husband.~
@2182 = ~I see. Then I am sincerely sorry for your loss--~
@2183 = ~I do not need your pity, Fade. Such sentiments do his memory no favours. You did not know him. Let us leave it at that.~

@2184 = ~Fade, Boo has been saying that you might be a... naughty thief. Please tell me this is not true!~
@2185 = ~Minsc--I'm a Shadow Thief! What did you think I was?~
@2186 = ~Maybe a cook... or a guard. I see you doing good, but Boo says you take things that do not belong to you, and that is not good.~
@2187 = ~Well... sometimes I do. But it's all in a good cause! I only take things from bad people... and the money goes to helping us on our, err, righteous mission.~
@2188 = ~See, Boo? No, do not tell tales! Fade is our friend, on the path to righteousness via the route of naughtiness! Minsc was right!~

@2189 = ~Minsc, what are you doing? Why are you... peering at my bottom?~
@2190 = ~Minsc and Boo were just wondering how it was attached.~
@2191 = ~What? How *what* is attached?~
@2192 = ~Your tail! Never has Minsc seen such a thing. Boo hasn't either. He has a tail, but it isn't long as yours. Do you buckle it on?~
@2193 = ~No! It's part of me!~
@2194 = ~Part... of you? But in Boo's experience, women do not have tails.~
@2195 = ~And Boo has had much experience of women, I take it?~
@2196 = ~We-ell, Boo has not told Minsc for sure, but Boo is very smart at getting into places no man or hamster has ever reached... so Minsc thinks, maybe!~

@2197 = ~(You wake up groggily after being mind-blasted by the illithid. As you pick yourself up and look to see if your companions are unharmed, your gaze rests on Fade. The Fey'ri is huddled in the corner, hugging her knees, her crimson eyes wide. She seems to be rocking slightly, muttering the same phrase over again in a guttural language you don't understand. You can only assume it is Abyssal)~
@2198 = ~(leave her be)~
@2199 = ~(stretch out your hand and touch her shoulder) Fade, are you all right?~
@2200 = ~(As your hand rests on her shoulder, she jumps, her eyes wild) Mind flayers! We've been captured by Mind flayers... Mind flayers... Mind flayers... ~
@2201 = ~Fade, calm down. We'll be okay.~
@2202 = ~Okay, Fade, you... err... have an insane moment in the corner, then. I'll be over... uh, there.~
@2203 = ~Okay? Okay?? You do know what mind flayers do, don't you? They turn you into slaves... into thralls... we're all going to be slaves!~
@2204 = ~Fade, pull yourself together! We are NOT going to be turned into thralls. We are NOT going to be slaves.~
@2205 = ~(pull her to you and hug her)~
@2206 = ~(She ignores you and continues to mutter to herself for a while. Suddenly she looks your way and whispers) I can't handle being a slave again, <CHARNAME>... I can't be a thrall!~
@2207 = ~(You cup her chin in your hand, making her look at you. You can feel her trembling through your hand--she is absolutely terrified) How can you be so sure?~
@2208 = ~Fade, I promise you, we will get out of this. You will never be a slave again, okay? I won't allow it. Please, try to calm down. Come on... breathe with me... ~
@2209 = ~Because I have no intention of letting my tale end here, Fade. So come on, now. I need you to be strong. Calm down and help me think about how we are going to get out of here.~
@2210 = ~(She accepts your embrace the same way a frightened child would--by clinging on to you as fiercely as she can. Her breathing is quick and shallow, and you can feel her heart thundering against her rib cage)~
@2211 = ~Please, Fade, try to calm down. We'll get out of this, I promise. You'll never have to be a slave again. Come on... breathe with me... ~
@2212 = ~(You feel her try to nod, and try to settle her breathing by imitating you. Her eyes never leave you face, and she seems to draw strength from your calm demeanor) Yes, we will be fine.~
@2213 = ~(She tries to smile, but it comes out as a twisted grimace. She is obviously still frightened, but you now know you will be able to count on her if necessary)~
@2214 = ~(She nods and sits down opposite you, studying your face, and she seems to draw strength from your calm demeanor) Yes, let us think about how we will get out.~

//LT54
@2215 = ~Can I ask you a silly question, <CHARNAME>?~
@2216 = ~Of course you can, my sweet. What is it?~
@2217 = ~(smile) That depends on just how silly it is, doesn't it?~
@2218 = ~Oh, Fade, not again. No, I don't know the one about the cleric, the rhinoceros and the vampire, nor do I know why clouds sometimes look like things, neither do I know why some people have, as you put it the other day, "funny looking heads"!~
@2219 = ~I just wanted to know... well... why did you agree to take me with you? You could easily have declined mine and Aran's offer. but you didn't.~
@2220 = ~I don't know. Seemed like a good idea at the time, I suppose.~
@2221 = ~Because you seemed so sincere in wanting to help me. I was wary of your intentions at first, but I've learnt to trust my instincts, and they were telling me to take you along.~
@2222 = ~Fade, why does it matter? All that matters is that I did take you, and I'm infinitely glad I did.~
@2223 = ~(grin) I thought you looked rather fine in all that black leather.~
@2224 = ~It's not too silly. I just wanted to know... well... why did you agree to take me with you? You could easily have declined mine and Aran's offer, but you didn't.~
@2225 = ~No! It's nothing like that... and what do you mean by that, anyway?!~
@2226 = ~Nothing. It's just that you can be a bit... random in what you talk about sometimes, that's all. So what did you want to know?~
@2227 = ~Well, you've got to admit it, Fade. You do talk utter nonsense sometimes!~
@2228 = ~I mean, unless it's important, don't bug me with it, okay?~
@2229 = ~Oh. That's all? Well... I suppose it's as good a reason as any.~
@2230 = ~What did you expect? I guessed you would be competent, and so I thought you could be useful. But that's all changed now.~
@2231 = ~Well, that and the fact that I thought you looked rather fine in all that black leather.~
@2232 = ~I admit, there were no thunderbolts when I first saw you. I was more worried that you might be a spy.. I had a job to do, and you offered to help me. That's it, I'm afraid.~
@2233 = ~Fade, when I first saw you, I thought you were the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. I was acutely aware that you were working for Aran, and I thought you were possibly his spy, but still I let you join us. And I'm glad I did.~
@2234 = ~Yes, I was very sincere. That surprised a few people. I had a bit of a reputation for being an "act first--think later" kind of person, but as soon as I found out what had happened, I knew I just had to help you. I'm glad I did.~
@2235 = ~As am I. I guessed you would be competent, and so I thought you could be useful. But that's all changed now.~
@2236 = ~(grin) Well, there was also the issue that I thought you looked mighty fine in all that black leather.~
@2237 = ~I thought I'd never admit this to anyone, much less you, but when I first saw you, I thought you were the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. I was acutely aware that you were working for Aran, and I thought you were possibly his spy, but still I let you join us. And I'm glad I did, too.~
@2238 = ~It matters because... well... I never intended any of this to happen. I joined you because I thought I could help you. But the more I think about it, the more it makes me wonder. You didn't have to take me along. You could have left me there, but you didn't.~
@2239 = ~What told you to take me along? What would have happened to me if you hadn't? Was it preordained? A fated meeting? Or merely a coincidence?~
@2240 = ~I believe we were fated to meet. I went with my instinct--I guessed you would be competent, but there was something else. I don't know what it was, but I just knew you had to come with me. And I'm glad you did.~
@2241 = ~It's just a coincidence, Fade. A happy one, but a coincidence, nothing more. I took you along because I thought you might be useful. Never did I think we would become this close. But we have, and that's what is important.~
@2242 = ~(grin) <CHARNAME>, I was trying to be serious!~
@2243 = ~I am being serious! When I first saw you, I thought you were the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. I was acutely aware that you were working for Aran, and I thought you were possibly his spy, but still I let you join us. And I'm glad I did, too.~
@2244 = ~(grin) Oh, come on, what was I supposed to do? A young lady, all clad in leather, offers me her services... I'm an impressionable young man, and that kind of thing *really* impresses me!~
@2245 = ~Nonsense?! I make informed and, ummm, knowledgeable remarks about my surroundings! (chuckle) Okay, I know I waffle on about rubbish sometimes, it's something that used to happen a lot in the Guild to pass the time when we were bored.~
@2246 = ~But this time I'm serious. Why did you agree to take me with you? You could easily have declined mine and Aran's s offer, but you didn't.~
@2247 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>, please don't be like that. This is important to me. I know that's not the same as important to the group, but there is something I would really like to ask you.~
@2248 = ~Yes, it has, hasn't it? You know, I never intended any of this to happen. I knew I wanted to help you--what happened to Imoen really struck a chord in me. I've been helping to try to stamp out the slave trade in Athkatla, but it's like trying to hold back the sea. As soon as we think we've stopped one route, another one pops up almost immediately.~
@2249 = ~I thought in helping you to rescue Imoen, another one so wrongfully incarcerated would be freed. I never once thought that the man I agreed to help would become so dear to me.~
@2250 = ~You've been helping the slaves escape? I bet Aran doesn't like that.~
@2251 = ~I will admit that when I first met you, I was very wary of you. But as I got to know you, I suppose it was inevitable that you would become dear to me too.~
@2252 = ~So, what did you think of me when we first met?~
@2253 = ~Not the answer I wanted to hear, but an honest one, and I thank you for that. I will admit, I never intended for any of this to happen either. I knew I wanted to help you--what happened to Imoen really struck a chord in me. I've been helping to try to stamp out the slave trade in Athkatla, but it's like trying to hold back the sea. As soon as we think we've stopped one route, another one pops up almost immediately.~
@2254 = ~(blush) Really? I... I never realized that. I thought I was just a burden to you.~
@2255 = ~You were never a burden to me. So, what did you think of me when we first met?~
@2256 = ~Why are you blushing? Hasn't anyone ever told you that you're beautiful before?~
@2257 = ~(grin) Oh, come on, what was I supposed to think? A young lady, all clad in leather, offers me her services... I'm an impressionable young man, and that kind of thing *really* impresses me!~
@2258 = ~Something told you? Well, I don't know what that would have been. I'm not big on Gods, nor fate. After everything that has happened to me, it seems absurd to put it down to either.~
@2259 = ~All I knew is that I wanted to help you--what happened to Imoen really struck a chord in me. I've been helping to try to stamp out the slave trade in Athkatla, but it's like trying to hold back the sea. As soon as we think we've stopped one route, another one pops up almost immediately.~
@2260 = ~Yes, it is, isn't it? You know, I never intended any of this to happen. I knew I wanted to help you--what happened to Imoen really struck a chord in me. I've been helping to try to stamp out the slave trade in Athkatla, but it's like trying to hold back the sea. As soon as we think we've stopped one route, another one pops up almost immediately.~
@2261 = ~(laugh) Oh, <CHARNAME>! If that's how you view women in black leather, you must have been is some kind of heaven in the Guild!~
@2262 = ~No, not really. You were the only one who affected me that way. Hasn't anyone ever told you that you're beautiful before?~
@2263 = ~Ahhh, I'm joking. I will admit that when I first met you, I was very wary of you. But as I got to know you, I suppose it was inevitable that you would become dear to me.~
@2264 = ~I suppose. What did you think of me when we first met?~
@2265 = ~Aran? He... doesn't know. At least I don't think he knows. He's never pulled me up for it. It's something I do when I get time to myself. I can't just sit there and watch people being used like that--I had to do something. Hence the reason I had to help you.~
@2266 = ~That's almost noble of you, Fade.~
@2267 = ~I see. So, what did you think of me when we first met?~
@2268 = ~Do you know the first thing that struck me about you? How... normal you are. I knew from the outset that you were a Bhaalspawn, and so I think I expected you to be... I don't know, a little larger-than-life, I suppose. But you're not.~
@2269 = ~And is that a bad thing?~
@2270 = ~I see. Were you disappointed?~
@2271 = ~I wasn't brought up to be a Bhaalspawn. I was brought up to be a normal person. A lot of people seem to expect me to be some kind of supernatural force, but I'm not.~
@2272 = ~The first thing that struck me about you was how... normal you were. I knew from the outset that you were a Bhaalspawn, and so I think I expected you to be... I don't know, a little larger-than-life, I suppose. But you're not.~
@2273 = ~No one who has ever counted, no. I hold no illusions about my... differences.~
@2274 = ~Your "differences", as you put them, are part of your charm, Fade. So, how about me? What did you think of me when we first met?~
@2275 = ~Okay, your "differences" did kind of trouble me for a while, but not now. I love you--all of you. So, how about me? What did you think of me when we first met?~
@2276 = ~Noble? Not really. Big paladins running around in shiny armour are noble, not larcenous petty thieves with a weakness for shiny things. I help because I don't like it--and I try to change things I don't like!~
@2277 = ~So, did you try to change me, then?~
@2278 = ~Okay, point taken. Well, I've spilled the beans--what about you? What did you think of me when we first met?~
@2279 = ~No, it isn't. I was expecting to be completely overwhelmed by you. Well, I suppose I was, in a way, just not in the way I was expecting.~
@2280 = ~You were? How?~
@2281 = ~The feeling is mutual. Once you'd been with us for a while, I didn't know what had hit me.~
@2282 = ~No, not at all. I... liked the fact that you were normal. I soon found myself being attracted to your strength--not your physical strength, but the way you seem to cope with things. You're so, well, dependable. I found that almost comforting.~
@2283 = ~Then you rescued me from Mallon. I knew then I was lost to you. I think I've been yours a lot longer than you realise... and possibly longer than I would care to admit.~
@2284 = ~And I for one am glad that you're not. I... liked the fact that you were normal. I soon found myself being attracted to your strength--not your physical strength, but the way you seem to cope with things. You're so, well, dependable. I found that almost comforting.~
@2285 = ~No, I didn't. I said I only like to change things I *don't* like... and I liked you from the outset. You are so strong--I don't mean your physical strength, but the way you cope with things. You're so, well, dependable. I found that almost comforting.~
@2286 = ~I... liked the fact that you were normal. What overwhelmed me was your strength--not your physical strength, but the way you seem to cope with things. I was overwhelmed by my own feelings for you.~
@2287 = ~(chuckle) If only we had been more honest with our feelings--it would have saved a lot of heartache and agonizing on my part, I can tell you! But I was overwhelmed by my feelings for you. You are so strong--I don't mean your physical strength, but the way you cope with things. You're so, well, dependable. I found that almost comforting.~

@2288 = ~(The party has stopped for a short break and you sit for awhile around the fire discussing the day's events so far and what the future may hold. Slowly the others drift off to collect their things, leaving you and Fade alone)~
@2289 = ~(Though she participated in the discussions there has been a darkness about her that even the light of the fire could not push back. Even now she gazes into the fire with a solemn and troubled look, lost in her own thoughts)~
@2290 = ~Fade, what is it? What has you so troubled?~
@2291 = ~You wear the darkness about you like a cloak. Take it off for a bit, you're safe.~
@2292 = ~Keep that look much longer and it'll freeze on your face, and we wouldn't want that.~
@2293 = ~It's nothing really, <CHARNAME>. Just thinking.~
@2294 = ~I know you better than that. It isn't "nothing". Please, you know you can tell me.~
@2295 = ~Something is weighing heavily on you, honeykitten, I can tell. It might help to talk about it.~
@2296 = ~Okay. Don't say I didn't ask. Come on, we have to go.~
@2297 = ~Am I, <CHARNAME>? I'm not so sure.~
@2298 = ~What do you mean?~
@2299 = ~Of course you're safe. You're surrounded by friends and we've dealt with the slavers, if that's what you're worried about.~
@2300 = ~(wrap her in your arms but say nothing)~
@2301 = ~What? I'm sorry. I wasn't really concentrating. I was thinking of... other things.~
@2302 = ~I didn't mean to add to your troubles.~
@2303 = ~Other things? What other things?~
@2304 = ~Now that I've pulled your attention from the fire, what's wrong?~
@2305 = ~(sigh) Since we last spoke, I have been thinking about... my past, and I'm worried we haven't seen the last of the Pasha. There is no way he would give up this easily.~
@2306 = ~I bought your contract. He has no legal right to you anymore.~
@2307 = ~His men are dead. A rational man would cut his losses.~
@2308 = ~(gather her into a warm embrace) It's been on my mind too.~
@2309 = ~(groan) Why do you call me that? Okay, you're just trying to cheer me up. (smile) Thank you. I have just been thinking about... my past recently--I'm just worried we haven't seen the last of the Pasha. There is no way he would give up this easily.~
@2310 = ~Wait, please. I... I have to speak to you.~
@2311 = ~I mean I've been thinking about my past a lot recently, and I'm not sure we've seen the last of the Pasha. I'm not convinced and... it scares me.~
@2312 = ~We killed those he sent after you. That should send a message. A rational person would cut his losses.~
@2313 = ~He has no legal claim on you anymore, Fade. You've destroyed the contract. What can he do?~
@2314 = ~I'm not so sure, <CHARNAME>. The Pasha won't give up so easily. He believes I've made a fool of him, and he suffers such from no one.~
@2315 = ~(gather her into a warm embrace) I've thought as much, but hoped I was wrong.~
@2316 = ~(Her tail snakes up between you to wrap itself around an arm. She makes small sounds of contentment as she eases back against your chest) Really? I... I don't want this to be your problem <CHARNAME>. It's something I have to deal with--you've got enough going on to worry about as it is.~
@2317 = ~Fade, your problems *are* my problems. That's what being together is all about. If it happens, and I sincerely hope it doesn't... well, we'll sort it out. The Pasha has no claim to you, and I won't let him take you.~
@2318 = ~Please, stop worrying what *might* happen. We may all get eaten by a dragon tomorrow--we don't know! There's really no point in letting it eat at you like this.~
@2319 = ~What worries me more is that you are unhappy. (Kiss her neck) What would it take to make you happy again?~
@2320 = ~You could never do that <CHARNAME>--never. If anyone is adding to troubles it'll probably be me.~
@2321 = ~You're worried about the Pasha aren't you? We've dealt with his men, Fade. You'll be alright.~
@2322 = ~(gather her into a warm embrace) Your troubles are my troubles Fade. I'd have it no other way.~
@2323 = ~But I do worry. There's no guarantee Mallon will give the gold to the Pasha or that the contract he gave you is even valid. It looked real enough, but it could have been a fake. I just don't think he'd give up so easily.~
@2324 = ~We beat him once, we could do it again.~
@2325 = ~I won't let him take you again, Fade. I promise you that.~
@2326 = ~In case you missed it in my previous discussions with you, the Pasha is *not* a rational man. He thinks I've made a fool of him and now, so have you. I doubt he'll simply suffer such insults.~
@2327 = ~I really don't think it will be up to you, <CHARNAME>. If he decides to come after me again, there will be no choice.~
@2328 = ~I can't help it. If he decides to come after me again, there will be no choice in the matter, believe me.~
@2329 = ~(smile) You do know how to take a girl's mind off her troubles, I'll you give that.~
@2330 = ~(tilt her head gently upwards) Oh? You think this is distracting?~
@2331 = ~The future will bring what it will. I'd much rather enjoy the here and now.~
@2332 = ~(hug her to you and nuzzle her cheek) I'm at your command.~
@2333 = ~I know, <CHARNAME>. It's just... ~
@2334 = ~(let her continue)~
@2335 = ~(silence her with a kiss)~
@2336 = ~I believe you, <CHARNAME>. It's just... ~
@2337 = ~(You lower your lips to hers gently at first, but this soon gives way to a hungry probing. You feel her tail constricting around you as she reaches up to pull your head closer to hers)~
@2338 = ~(When you finally break free, it is obvious you have distracted Fade from her melancholy thoughts. She looks at you with eyes alight with desire and there is tightness low in your body)~
@2339 = ~You've really got to stop doing that to me, <CHARNAME>, but I take your point. Stop worrying about the past, and fearing the future.~
@2340 = ~(grin) In fact... I think I'm rather looking forward to our immediate future. (She pulls you closer to her and kisses you again)~
@2341 = ~Yes, sometimes that sentiment is appropriate. (grins) Although what *you* undoubtedly have on your mind will have to wait until later! I think we have to get going now, or we won't be popular!~
@2342 = ~Oh, really? (She turns to face you a wicked smile on her face) Well, let's just see how well you take orders later on... ~
@2343 = ~I... I couldn't bear it if you were injured because of me. I just couldn't... .~
@2344 = ~And I couldn't bear to have you taken away from me. I am a Child of Bhaal and if need be I will remind the Pasha of that, even if I have to bring his palace down around him to do it.~
@2345 = ~No more than I could bear to have you taken from me. Enough of this, we both have enough bad memories--let us make some good ones.~
@2346 = ~(sigh) Hearing you say that... that you'd come for me, no matter what... it makes me feel truly safe for the first time I can remember. Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@2347 = ~(grin) My thoughts exactly! Although maybe later, huh? I think we have to get going now, or we won't be popular!~

//LT58
@2348 = ~You know, it's funny how things have worked out. I sometimes wonder how things would have turned out if Keita had escaped... if she were still alive.~
@2349 = ~You really miss her, don't you?~
@2350 = ~Fade, you really have to stop torturing yourself over what happened to Keita.~
@2351 = ~I've wondered that myself. Would we have even met? I doubt it.~
@2352 = ~Yes, I do. She deserved to escape more that I did. She endured much, much more than me for much, much longer. It... it doesn't seem fair that I am here, enjoying myself, while she is dead.~
@2353 = ~You really have to stop torturing yourself this, Fade. Like I have said before, it wasn't your fault.~
@2354 = ~Unfortunately, these things happen. All you can do now is look to the future, and on what we have.~
@2355 = ~What are you saying? That you'd rather she was alive and that we had never met?~
@2356 = ~Fade, please, I don't want to keep going over this. It happened, and there was nothing you could do.~
@2357 = ~I... I can't help it, <CHARNAME>. I know I did everything in my power to keep her safe, but she still died. I look at myself now and wonder how different I would be as a person if she had survived.~
@2358 = ~Yes, I doubt it too. I expect Keita and I would have traveled further north, to Luskan, or to Waterdeep. I certainly wouldn't have become a Shadow Thief. We talked about it a lot--traveling around, helping people in the same situation as us. If only... if only she hadn't died on me.~
@2359 = ~So what you're basically saying is I should just get over it? Just forget her and concentrate solely on you? Act like she had never existed... like she never mattered?~
@2360 = ~Fade, I didn't mean it like that, and you know it!~
@2361 = ~Stop being so defensive! All I am saying is you can't keep dwelling on the past all the time.~
@2362 = ~No, of course not! Her memory should be honoured, but not to the expense of your future happiness.~
@2363 = ~Of course I would rather she was alive! I mean... of course I'm glad we've met and everything, but at the expense of someone's life? I... I can't help it <CHARNAME>, but sometimes I feel very guilty.~
@2364 = ~You can't keep focusing on the past like this. What happened, *happened*. Don't let it ruin what we have.~
@2365 = ~Don't be defensive, Fade--you know what I mean!~
@2366 = ~Keita wouldn't have wanted you to feel guilty about being happy, Fade. It's right to remember her, but not at the expense of your future happiness!~
@2367 = ~Oh, so I'm boring you now? Well, I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>! Would you prefer it if I just forgot her altogether then, and concentrated solely on you?~
@2368 = ~Do I? You're asking me to basically dismiss one of the most important people in my life. Alive or dead, Keita meant everything to me! I thought you at least would understand that.~
@2369 = ~Of course I understand that! I feel exactly the same way about Imoen.~
@2370 = ~Of course I understand! Her memory should be honoured, but not at the expense on your future happiness.~
@2371 = ~I'm NOT being defensive! I don't see that there is anything wrong with remembering you loved ones and feeling bad about the fact that they are *dead*.~
@2372 = ~And I'm not saying that there *is* anything wrong with remembering the dead! All I am saying is that you shouldn't sacrifice your future happiness by focusing on it all the time!~
@2373 = ~Please, stop dwelling on the past all the time. What happened, *happened*. Don't let it ruin what we have.~
@2374 = ~Maybe you forget, but I too have lost loved ones... many of us here have. And although we remember them every day of our lives, we don't let their memory get to us in the way that the memory of Keita gets to you!~
@2375 = ~<CHARNAME>, Keita is part of who I am! Without her, I certainly wouldn't be here today--and I don't think you understand that!~
@2376 = ~I do understand, Fade. I just don't want it to ruin what we have!~
@2377 = ~Always thinking of yourself, huh, <CHARNAME>? I... I've had enough of talking to you now. I need some time to myself to remember my dead friend.~
@2378 = ~Yes, but at least there's a good chance Imoen is still alive! There is still a good chance everything will be okay for the two of you. Not so for Keita and me!~
@2379 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I think I need some time to myself now. Whether you like it or not, I need to think about my very *dead* friend.~
@2380 = ~But Imoen is alive! You *did* manage to rescue her--I never had the luxury!~
@2381 = ~Well, maybe I can't cope with these things as well as you can! I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I think I need some time to myself now. Whether you like it or not, I need to think about my very *dead* friend.~

//LT60
@2382 = ~(She catches your arm and entwines her fingers around yours) Hi.~
@2383 = ~Hey, how are you? Have you calmed down now?~
@2384 = ~Fade, I never meant to upset you over Keita. I suppose I didn't realise everything is still so raw for you.~
@2385 = ~What do you want?~
@2386 = ~Yes. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I realise now what you were trying to say to me, but I was in such a bleak mood... I shouldn't have taken it out on you.~
@2387 = ~You don't have to apologise. I'm just thankful you realise I wasn't trying to upset you.~
@2388 = ~I'm sorry too. I suppose I thought that after all this time, things wouldn't still be so raw for you. I didn't mean to upset you.~
@2389 = ~All I want is for you to be happy, Fade. I don't want you to forget Keita, just to stop punishing yourself over what happened.~
@2390 = ~I know you didn't. I just get a little... oversensitive about things occasionally, and I'm sorry. I really shouldn't take it out on you.~
@2391 = ~It's okay. I'm just thankful you realise I wasn't trying to upset you.~
@2392 = ~(smile) I suppose we inevitably hit out against those we are dearest to. I don't blame you.~
@2393 = ~(sigh) I suppose I deserve as much. I... I just want to say I'm sorry--again. I realise now what you were trying to say to me, and you're right. I shouldn't let Keita's death get to me so much. And I certainly shouldn't have taken it out on you. I'm sorry.~
@2394 = ~I know. And you're right, I do need to let go--to remember Keita as she was in life, not in death. She wouldn't want me to be dwelling on this. She would be pleased that I'm so happy with you. I... shouldn't feel guilty.~
@2395 = ~Letting go doesn't mean you have to forget her. Treasure her memory--don't use it as a weapon against yourself!~
@2396 = ~And I'm pleased you have realized that at last. You are allowed a little bit of happiness in your life!~
@2397 = ~What brought this about, anyway? Are you still concerned about the Pasha?~
@2398 = ~I'll try, <CHARNAME>. I realise now that all of this negativity does her memory no favours--it won't bring her back. I should be thankful for what I have now... and be thankful that I did at least have the chance to know her, even if it was cut short so cruelly.~
@2399 = ~I know nothing I can say will take away the pain of your loss, even after all these years, but please know that I am here for you. Treasure her memory--don't use it as a weapon against yourself!~
@2400 = ~Be thankful, but don't feel guilty about allowing yourself a little bit of happiness in your life. If Keita cared for you half as much as you obviously cared for her, she would never begrudge you that.~
@2401 = ~Yes, I suppose we do. You know, I actually blamed Keita for what happened for months afterwards? I thought her... selfish for leaving me. Then I realized I was being the selfish one, and that hurt.~
@2402 = ~Now I understand. I do need to let go and remember Keita as she was in life, not in death. She wouldn't want me to be dwelling on this. She would be pleased that I'm so happy with you. I... shouldn't feel guilty.~
@2403 = ~Fade, the way you felt after Keita's death was totally normal. I felt exactly the same after Gorion died. I still feel that way sometimes, but that's only natural. I would be a lot more concerned if it didn't bother you.~
@2404 = ~I'll try, <CHARNAME>, I really will. Thank you for understanding.~
@2405 = ~(smile) I think you qualify as a little more than just a *little* bit of happiness, <CHARNAME>.~
@2406 = ~Yes, I am. And in thinking about him, I inevitably started thinking about Keita. If anyone is to blame, it's that bastard.~
@2407 = ~Please, don't think about him. You're safe now, and entitled to a little bit of happiness as much as the next person.~
@2408 = ~And if I *ever* get to meet that bastard... ~
@2409 = ~You... you felt the same way after Gorion's death? I didn't know that. I thought it may have been because I am Fey'ri. We're not known for our compassion, but if that's not the case... thank you, <CHARNAME>. That is a great comfort to me.~
@2410 = ~I hope you never do. I can't risk losing someone else I love to him.~

//LT62
@2411 = ~I know I've asked you something like this before, <CHARNAME>, but do you ever think of the future?~
@2412 = ~What do you mean?~
@2413 = ~Of course I do. I'm always thinking about what is going to happen next.~
@2414 = ~Not much. So much has happened to me recently, I haven't given it a lot of thought.~
@2415 = ~Well... after all this. After you've sorted Irenicus out. What then?~
@2416 = ~Oh, that. No, I haven't given it much thought, to be honest with you.~
@2417 = ~I'm not entirely sure. It would be nice to leave the adventuring life behind, though... ~
@2418 = ~I expect I'll carry on seeking adventure. I can't ever see myself settling down.~
@2419 = ~So... what then? What do you see?~
@2420 = ~It would be nice to settle down, I suppose, leave the adventuring life behind. I quite fancy a little farm somewhere.~
@2421 = ~I'd like to think I'd still be adventuring. I can't ever see myself settling down.~
@2422 = ~I can understand that sentiment. I suppose with everything you've been through, *not* living on a purely day-to-day basis would seem pretty strange.~
@2423 = ~What are you suggesting, then? That you do our thinking for us? What do you want for the future?~
@2424 = ~Exactly. Although I suppose settling down would be nice... ~
@2425 = ~Well, I can't ever see myself ever abandoning the adventuring life and settling down. I don't think I'd do that very well.~
@2426 = ~Really? You'd like to leave the adventuring life? That does kind of surprise me.~
@2427 = ~Why should it? I quite fancy getting myself a little farm somewhere.~
@2428 = ~(grin) So you'd expect me to still be adventuring when I'm old and grey, huh? No, I don't think so. By that time, I think I'd like to be settled, with a tribe of grandchildren to tell my tales to.~
@2429 = ~I thought you'd say that. But do you ever just wish you could... leave it all behind and just live a simpler, more settled life?~
@2430 = ~No, it would drive me insane! Could you imagine it? Waking in the same bed everyday, doing the same chores day in day out... it would be so boring!~
@2431 = ~Maybe later--just not right now. I'd like to see more of Faerun before I ever think of settling down.~
@2432 = ~(laugh) A farm? For some reason, I can't see you feeding chickens, <CHARNAME>.~
@2433 = ~Why not? It would be nice: the two of us, with a little place of our own. Unless that's not what you want.~
@2434 = ~Yes, I suppose it does stretch the imagination a bit. So what do you see for us, then?~
@2435 = ~(grin) Well, if you're going to laugh at me... what do *you* want for the future?~
@2436 = ~Me? I'm not really sure. That's why I asked you. I... I suppose I just wondered if I had a place in your future.~
@2437 = ~Of course you do! I can't imagine a future without you... unless that's not what you want.~
@2438 = ~Who knows what the future may bring? Let's just enjoy what we have now, and worry about what happens next when it happens!~
@2439 = ~Grandchildren? But for that you need children.~
@2440 = ~What's wrong, Fade? Don't you want kids?~
@2441 = ~Fade, I think you're jumping ahead of yourself here. Who knows what the future may bring? Let's just enjoy what we have now, and worry about what comes next when it happens.~
@2442 = ~(sigh) Yes, after all the excitement, settling down would seem boring. But even if you did continue to adventure... would you want me with you?~
@2443 = ~Of course I would! I can't imagine a future without you... unless that's not what you want.~
@2444 = ~Well, you already know I would agree with you on that. I'd love to see more of Faerun. With you. If that's what you want.~
@2445 = ~Of course that's what I want! I can't imagine a future without you... unless that's not what you want.~
@2446 = ~(You hold her close, and she returns your embrace, her head on your shoulder. You both stand for a long moment enjoying the closeness till Fade moves back enough to look at you)~
@2447 = ~That's what I want. Wherever I go or whatever I do, so long as you're with me, I know I'll be happy... and safe.~
@2448 = ~And you'll never be bored. (drop your hands to her hips and tickle her)~
@2449 = ~And loved. (kiss her)~
@2450 = ~(grin) What do I see? I'd like to think that I'd see us. Together. For a long, long time.~
@2451 = ~I'm glad we agree! It would be nice to settle down someday, with a tribe of grandchildren to tell our tales to.~
@2452 = ~Of course I do! As long as that's what you want too.~
@2453 = ~Oh. Well, I suppose you're right. Let us live life for the now. (She smiles and kisses you lightly, pulling you closer to her)~
@2454 = ~(She looks slightly embarrassed) Well... maybe, one day. Although I'm not too sure I'd make such a great mother.~
@2455 = ~(She then laughs and cups your chin with her hand) But I fear we are getting ahead of ourselves! I suppose I just wondered... if I had a place in your future, that's all.~
@2456 = ~(She makes a small sound of surprise that quickly gives way to laughter that fills the air) Oh no, not with you. *Never* will I be bored.~
@2457 = ~(She slaps your hand away) Come on. We've got a ways to go yet, and you can use the time to think of how you'll cure my... boredom tonight.~
@2458 = ~(Your lips find hers as your hand slides up into her hair. The kiss is long and soft, your tongues slowly caressing each other's lips. When you finally pull back you are both wearing contented smiles) Now how could I forget that?~
@2459 = ~(She takes your hand in hers and gives you a wink) Come on, we have a ways to go yet. Besides, I think I may have a memory lapse tonight, and you can use the time to think of how you'll... remind me I'm loved.~

@2460 = ~(You awaken to the dulcet sounds of someone being sick out of the window) No... no more... there isn't anything left... urrggh... ~
@2461 = ~(whisper) Serve you right!~
@2462 = ~Are you alright?~
@2463 = ~What did I say last night? I've got no sympathy for you!~
@2464 = ~(Get up and go over to her) Awww... poor baby.~
@2465 = ~I know you're awake. Go and get me a glass of water and... oh no... uurrrghhh... ~
@2466 = ~Nope, can't hear you. Anyway, I'm asleep.~
@2467 = ~No... It feels like a pig shat in my head.~
@2468 = ~Nice mental picture, Fade. Thanks for that. You want anything?~
@2469 = ~Please, the last thing I need now is... ulp... (takes some deep breaths) ... no, no, I'm okay... a lecture! I feel terrible enough already.~
@2470 = ~(Get up and go over to her) Aww... poor baby. Come to <CHARNAME>.~
@2471 = ~So you're not going to want any breakfast either?~
@2472 = ~(grin) I know something that'll make you feel better... ~
@2473 = ~Oh, ha ha. Don't be so bloody sarcastic. I really do feel... oohh... quite... ulp... dreadfu... (She leans out of the window again to be sick)~
@2474 = ~(sigh) That's right, get it all up. Maybe next time you'll think twice before challenging some dwarves to a drinking competition, eh?~
@2475 = ~I can cope with blood and gore, but sick? Sorry, Fade, but you're on your own!~
@2476 = ~Bastard... It feels like a pig shat in my head.~
@2477 = ~To die now, painlessly. Uuurrrggg... I'm NEVER drinking again, ever! (She leans out of the window to be sick again)~
@2478 = ~No!~
@2479 = ~So, you don't want some lovely, crispy bacon, topped with a deliciously oozing runny egg, with yolk just dripping?~
@2480 = ~That's okay then, I can eat yours!~
@2481 = ~Well, if that's the case, I know something that'll make you feel better... ~
@2482 = ~And is this "something" the same "something" that you claim to be the miracle cure for all headaches, back pain and stomach cramps too?~
@2483 = ~Heh heh... yep! <CHARNAME>'s magic wand, cures what ails you!~
@2484 = ~Well, it would take your mind off being ill.~
@2485 = ~Yes... bloody dwarves... all their fault!~
@2486 = ~Hmmm. Because they held you down and just threw the drink down your throat, didn't they?~
@2487 = ~Yes, dear, of course it is.~
@2488 = ~Bloody coward. (sigh) Go on then. I'll be okay in a bit. Go, have some breakfast and get ready, I should be alright by then.~
@2489 = ~Bastard! (She throws up out of the window again) Please... if you're going to talk about food, just bugger off and do it elsewhere. I don't think I can cope.~
@2490 = ~(sigh) Okay, I was only teasing. Maybe next time you'll think *twice* before challenging some dwarves to a drinking competition, eh?~
@2491 = ~Okay, okay, I'll go! Just make sure you're alright to travel in a bit. We can't stop here all day.~
@2492 = ~Yes, you can eat mine. Go on, off you go. I'll be okay in a bit. Go, have some breakfast and get ready, I should be alright by then.~
@2493 = ~You just don't give up, do you?! <CHARNAME>, believe me, that is the *last* thing on my mind at the moment. Anyway, there's a very good chance I'd be sick on you, and I don't think you'd appreciate that.~
@2494 = ~(nuzzle the back of her neck) Sure I can't change your mind?~
@2495 = ~Eww... maybe you do have a point. Perhaps I'll go and get myself something to eat instead.~
@2496 = ~No it wouldn't! I just want to crawl into bed and die, not crawl into bed and be jumped by you! (grin) Well, not this time, anyway.~
@2497 = ~Ahhh. Maybe later then?~
@2498 = ~Well, at least I got a smile out of you. Perhaps I'll go get myself something to eat and see you later?~
@2499 = ~Oh, I wondered when you'd say that. Okay, okay, I've only got myself to blame! Still, bloody dwarves... Look, why don't you go and get ready and get yourself something to eat? I should be okay by then. Just get me a glass of water!~
@2500 = ~Oh, don't be so insufferably agreeable, <CHARNAME>. Go on, make yourself useful. Go and get me a glass of water, then go and get ready and get yourself something to eat. I should be okay by then.~
@2501 = ~Yes, yes, yes, point taken. Get me a glass of water, then go and get ready and get yourself something to eat. I should be okay by then.~
@2502 = ~(laugh) You're incorrigible! No, you can't change my mind. Go on, my horny champion. Go and get me a glass of water, then go and get ready and get yourself something to eat. I should be okay by then.~
@2503 = ~Yes, that's a good idea. Go and get ready and get yourself something to eat. I should be okay by then.~
@2504 = ~Okay, <CHARNAME>... maybe later. Now go and get me a glass of water, then go and get ready and get yourself something to eat. I should be okay by then.~

@2505 = ~I must say, I still cannot believe that <CHARNAME> even allowed you to join us, Fade. Let it be known that I shall never trust you, and whilst you travel with us, I shall always be watching you.~
@2506 = ~*Always* be watching me, Anomen? I'm sure I could have you arrested for that.~
@2507 = ~I suppose I should have expected such a response from one of your kind. Never did I think I would have to travel with a Shadow Thief!~
@2508 = ~Well, now, that's unfortunate, isn't it? Especially since <CHARNAME>'s joined our ranks and everything. I would say you're outnumbered, Anomen.~
@2509 = ~Well, <CHARNAME > is the one calling the shots here, not you, so I think you can just toddle off back to your position and concentrate on being righteous, while the rest of us have some fun.~

@2510 = ~Have you ever travelled to Sigil?~
@2511 = ~No... never.~
@2512 = ~You surprise me, magpie! I know of your history--the Hellgate Saga is indeed an interesting one--but do the Planes not call to you?~
@2513 = ~Not really. Since the only other Plane I have had contact with is the Abyss, it hasn't done anything to whet my appetite to visit others.~
@2514 = ~But Sigil is a great city. Cruel, but exhilarating; brutal, but beautiful. Great heroes and villains walk its crooked streets, and there is adventure to be found at every turn. Ahhh... the Primes think they know of diversity and excitement, but compared to Sigil, there is nothing but routine and the mundane.~
@2515 = ~Well, if Sigil is so great, why are you here?~
@2516 = ~Discovery and exploration has her claws in this humble sparrow, and for all that Sigil has to recommend it, how else can I experience what the Prime has to offer? One day I will return... but until then, I shall travel.~

@2517 = ~What does it feel like to have faith?~
@2518 = ~What kind of question is that to ask anyone, Fade?~
@2519 = ~Well, you are a paladin and all... I just thought you would be the best person to ask.~
@2520 = ~I suppose I am as good as any, but it's still a surprising question. Are you saying you have no faith at all--in anything? I thought that even... thieves... had their own deities.~
@2521 = ~Come now, Keldorn. Thief I may be, but we're not all bad.~
@2522 = ~Please, forgive an old paladin for his even older misconceptions and prejudices. I know you are good of heart, if not necessarily of deed.~
@2523 = ~(grin) How could I not forgive you? But still... back to my question.~
@2524 = ~Faith... let me see... it is hard to explain. For me, it is like having a guiding light--Torm shows me the way. He protects me, and my family. I know I am safe in his care, so I trust him implicitly. I do not flounder under his tutelage; my life has purpose.~
@2525 = ~That sounds like a... nice way to live. But what if you come into conflict with him? Would Torm put up with that?~
@2526 = ~And why would I come into conflict with my God? It would be like conflicting with myself.~
@2527 = ~Fade, I fear I am trying to explain something to you that is very personal to each individual. I hope that you do one day gain a faith... something that gives you something to believe in.~
@2528 = ~You know, you're totally different from what I imagined a paladin would be like. I had thought them all stuffy, meddling, over-pious do-gooders... but you're not.~

@2529 = ~Get out of my way, rich kid.~
@2530 = ~What? I wasn't anywhere near you!~
@2531 = ~I can see you, and that's enough for me.~
@2532 = ~What is your problem with me, Fade? I don't see you being this beastly to anyone else.~
@2533 = ~My "problem" with you is that you have no idea of what you're talking about. If I have to hear about how you "help the needy" one more time, I'm going to be sick.~
@2534 = ~And what is wrong with that? Maybe you don't realise--or maybe you just don't care--but they need all the help I can give them!~
@2535 = ~Oh? Really? So how did your lounging around in your huge castle while they toiled in the fields to ensure there was food on your table help them, exactly? By giving them employment?~
@2536 = ~I cannot help it if I was born privileged! I have never been cruel to any of the castles servants. I have always treated them with respect, and spared a coin when I could.~
@2537 = ~A right little Ilmater, aren't you? Ever thought about giving them enough so they didn't have to slave for you anymore? No, I didn't think so. Just... go away.~

@2538 = ~I can't help but feel that we have got off on the wrong foot. I know about your causes, and I believe in them too! I just wish you would give me a chance.~
@2539 = ~A chance? I don't think so. Live in the gutter for a month, and then we'll speak. Until then, you have no clue what real suffering is about, Nalia... none at all.~

@2540 = ~You there! Yes, you--slave girl! Come here and rub my feet.~
@2541 = ~Are you talking to *me*?~
@2542 = ~(Deaf as well as stupid, I see) Yes, of course I am! Who else do you think I refer to? Now get to it.~
@2543 = ~How dare you! You demand I rub your feet--how about I cut them off?!~
@2544 = ~Bah! What's the point of having servants if they won't do as they're told?~

@2545 = ~So what made you turn your life as a sneak into a spell thrower?~
@2546 = ~(grin) I'm not sure. Shiny things are nice, but being able to manipulate raw arcane power... that's something else!~
@2547 = ~I suppose so, although it's been a long time since I cast any spells.~
@2548 = ~You were a spell caster once? What happened?~
@2549 = ~I lost my powers. I had a certain amount of innate magical power. My tutors tried to teach me how to use it properly, but I really couldn't be arsed. (sigh) Then I lost it. I kind of regret it.~
@2550 = ~So... how did you lose your powers? Did you just wake up one morning and find them gone?~
@2551 = ~No, I lost them gradually. (sigh) You... you know I was a slave? Well, a slave with magical powers doesn't make a good slave. I was forced to wear manacles that suppressed my magic. Whether it was the years of not using it, or whether the manacles themselves somehow sucked the magic right out of me, I don't know. Still--too late for regrets. We are what life makes us... and there's nothing we can do about it!~

@2552 = ~What was it like, growing up with <CHARNAME>? Were you as bad as <PRO_HESHE> likes to make out?~
@2553 = ~Me? The bad one? Hardly! <PRO_HESHE> was always blaming me for everything, getting me into trouble, saying I was the one who kept stealing the cookies, that I was the one who distracted <PRO_HIMHER> from <PRO_HISHER> chores and studies... (grin)~
@2554 = ~(wink) Ahhh. I guessed that might be the case.~
@2555 = ~You'd never know from that innocent little expression, would you?~
@2556 = ~So... stealing cookies, right? How often did you manage that?~
@2557 = ~A lot more times that I would care to admit, Fade. Well, in the presence of <CHARNAME>, anyway!~

@2558 = ~That's some mighty shiny armour you're wearing, Anomen.~
@2559 = ~Well, it doesn't do oneself any favours to look a disgrace, does it?~
@2560 = ~No, it doesn't. Although I do suppose people may wonder when you get the time to polish it. Considering all the heroic things you've done, I'm surprised you even have the time to sit down, let alone polish your helmet until it gleams... (flutters her eyelashes at Anomen)~
@2561 = ~What?!~
@2562 = ~Well... all that rubbing? It takes time! No wonder you've got such a nice, strong right arm. (grin)~
@2563 = ~Why must you bring down everything I say to the basest of levels? I... I tire of talking to you, fiendling. Leave me be!~

@2564 = ~So, little Shadow Thief! We are working together.~
@2565 = ~No, I don't think we are. We are simply helping out the same person.~
@2566 = ~What is that? Surely you do not share Renal's disdain? We should work together!~
@2567 = ~My Shadow Master warned me of you, thieving on our patch without the backing of the guild. How do we know you aren't a spy for the other guild?~
@2568 = ~You wound me! I am but an honest thief; never have I plotted against the Shadow Thieves, nor against the Shadow Master. I was simply trying to survive.~
@2569 = ~Honest thief? A bit of an oxymoron... remember who you are speaking to! But I'm watching you, Yoshimo. Any treachery, and you *will* be dealt with.~

@2570 = ~I... I just wanted to say that I was very sorry to hear about your capture and subsequent incarceration, Aerie.~
@2571 = ~Wh-what? Why should you care? I mean... I wouldn't have thought you would even have considered it.~
@2572 = ~Well, I have, and if you ever need... you know... someone to talk to about it... well, you know where I am.~
@2573 = ~Th-thank you Fade. Although I don't know if you could be of any help to me.~
@2574 = ~You'd be surprised, Aerie--I think we have more in common than you could ever imagine.~

@2575 = ~You know, you remind me a lot of me sometimes, Viconia.~
@2576 = ~I seriously doubt that, naut kleel uss. You come from the gutter. I do not. Let us leave it at that.~
@2577 = ~No... you may not like it, but we have a lot in common. (smiles sweetly) I used to be an unpleasant, bitter old bitch too, you know.~
@2578 = ~Indeed? Well I have *never* been a gutter whore, so I fail to see any similarities between us. Bwael tangi, Fade... xun naut vrine'winith ulu sevir ussta llanath. That is to say--Good day... do not hesitate to leave my presence.~

@2579 = ~Why do you persist in keeping that... protrusion, Fade?~
@2580 = ~Protrusion? You mean my tail? Well, it's not like I can just get rid of it--it's part of me!~
@2581 = ~You could have cut it off. I could easily arrange that for you. It wouldn't hurt... much.~
@2582 = ~Get away, Viconia! I don't *want* to lose my tail! It's part of who I am.~
@2583 = ~Hmmm? Part of who you are? I suppose there is some truth in that statement. Many animals have tails... so why shouldn't you?~

@2584 = ~Why so glum, chum?~
@2585 = ~Fade, if you are going to be insufferably perky, can you do it to someone else? I am in no mood for it today.~
@2586 = ~(sigh) Come on, Valygar, there's no need to be so sour. Just a smile--one small smile. Is that so hard?~
@2587 = ~Yes, it is. Please, just leave me be.~
@2588 = ~Come on... smile... ~
@2589 = ~Fade... ~
@2590 = ~Smile... let's see those lovely lips of yours in something other than a frown... ~
@2591 = ~Pardon?~
@2592 = ~(grin) See what depths I will subject myself to? Or am I going to have to sink even lower and tickle you too?~

//LT64
@2593 = ~(She snakes an arm around your waist and grins at you. She then winks, and you feel her roving hand travel south, looking for gaps in your armour) I wonder what we have in here...~
@2594 = ~(grin) You know damn well what's in there. Pack it in!~
@2595 = ~(mock-growl) Minx.~
@2596 = ~Fade, what are you doing?!~
@2597 = ~Oi, stop that!~
@2598 = ~(She flutters her eyelashes at you playfully as her hand continues its roving) Oh come on, <CHARNAME>... where's your sense of adventure?~
@2599 = ~(whisper) I said pack it in!~
@2600 = ~Fade, not with everyone else around! We might get caught.~
@2601 = ~Adventure? So what are you suggesting? That we just get it on here and now, in front of everyone?~
@2602 = ~(snicker) So... what do you think? (She bites her bottom lip, looking up at you expectantly)~
@2603 = ~No... not here, not now. Later on, okay?~
@2604 = ~What? Right here, in front of everyone?~
@2605 = ~(grin) Isn't it obvious?~
@2606 = ~Yes, you little minx!~
@2607 = ~Come on, let's just stop for a bit. (Her grin widens*) I'll make it worth your while...~
@2608 = ~I said stop it and I mean stop it!~
@2609 = ~I know. (whisper) But that's what makes it all the more exciting...~
@2610 = ~Not for me it doesn't! Maybe later, when we're alone, okay?~
@2611 = ~Exciting? Really?~
@2612 = ~You really are a terrible influence on me, you know.~
@2613 = ~Of course not! We could just stop for a bit and find somewhere a little more secluded.~
@2614 = ~But we might still get caught!~
@2615 = ~(She looks slightly disappointed and rather frustrated) Alright... (grin) But you'd better have something quite spectacular in mind, okay?~
@2616 = ~(She moves her hand and hugs your arm) I'm sorry... I didn't mean to embarrass you.~
@2617 = ~(She nods, grinning wickedly) Now you just go and tell everyone we're taking a break, and I'll meet *you* over there. (She points to a secluded spot)~
@2618 = ~No problem!~
@2619 = ~Fade, I didn't mean that as an invitation. I can't do this here and now. Maybe later on, okay?~
@2620 = ~(She grins wickedly) I aim to please,  <CHARNAME>. Now you just go and tell everyone we're taking a break, and I'll meet *you* over there. (She points to a secluded spot)~
@2621 = ~(As you turn to leave, she grabs your arm and whispers in your ear) But don't take too long, or I may be... forced to start without you. (wink)~

//LT66
@2622 = ~That is it. I'm free. No longer just someone's lackey... and I have you to thank for it all, <CHARNAME>! I... I thought I knew what happiness was before, but now I know it was all just an illusion, because this is true happiness. You are true happiness.~
@2623 = ~(say nothing, just hold her close to you)~
@2624 = ~(smile) You're making me blush.~
@2625 = ~No, I'm not true happiness. The knowledge that you are able to do what you want from now on is true happiness. Being true to yourself is real happiness. I'm just glad I was able to help you.~
@2626 = ~(She holds you tightly back, and you soon realise from the trembling in her shoulders that she is crying)~
@2627 = ~Fade, come now... why are you upset? This is a happy time, not crying time!~
@2628 = ~You don't need to cry, sweetheart. Everything has worked out fine.~
@2629 = ~Don't be so melodramatic, Fade. Come on, we're drawing a crowd! Let's just... you know... get on with what we have to do.~
@2630 = ~It's true, though. I joined up with you to achieve one goal, and you've allowed me to achieve so much more, more than I ever dreamed possible. I... I don't think there is anything I can do to ever repay you. I... you... it's just...~
@2631 = ~(She trails off, obviously lost for words)~
@2632 = ~Us being together is not a transaction, Fade! Think of all the things you've done for me in the past! And of the things you are bound to do for me... for us... in the future. I wouldn't have it any other way.~
@2633 = ~You're absolutely hopeless! I've done these things because I love you, not to gain something from you! We're a partnership, kid... and a bloody fine one too.~
@2634 = ~(laugh) Always so modest! But you know I speak the truth. I joined up with you to achieve one goal, and you've allowed me to achieve so much more, more than I ever dreamed possible. I... I don't think there is anything I can do to ever repay you. I... you... it's just...~
@2635 = ~I can't help it! And I'm not crying because I'm upset. I... I... just can't seem to help it!~
@2636 = ~I've heard of tears of joy, but this is ridiculous. Come on, honeykitten! Dry those eyes and look to the future with me.~
@2637 = ~Women! You're all crazy. I suppose that's why I love you, though!~
@2638 = ~I know it has. It's just all a bit overwhelming. You've turned my life upside down. I can't believe it's happened, that you've actually freed me from all this, that we're together, that I'm part of your life... I can't repay you for any of this, <CHARNAME>!~
@2639 = ~(She wipes her eyes with the back of her hand) Yes, I know... I'm sorry. It's all just a bit overwhelming. Let's just go and get your soul back. That's the important thing here.~
@2640 = ~I know you're right, <CHARNAME>. Compared to your problems, mine are completely trivial! At least I can be with you now, to help you get your soul back. Let's go and sort that Irenicus out once and for all!~
@2641 = ~(She grins despite herself) Indeed! Together we can only be stronger. Let's go and sort that Irenicus out once and for all!~
@2642 = ~(She grins despite herself and dries her eyes on the back of her hand) I'll try! Maybe once this is all over, we can find a nice deserted, secret little place we can call our own for a while... but until then, let's go and sort that Irenicus out once and for all!~
@2643 = ~(laugh) And I suppose you males make perfect sense all the time! But still... thank you. For everything. Now let's go and sort that Irenicus out once and for all!~

@2644 = ~You really should make more of those beautiful curves you have, "Edwina". You know, lift and separate? (waggles her eyebrows)~
@2645 = ~No! Not you as well, you miserable wench! I swear, once I am restored, all of you shall pay for your incessant teasing! (I must be rid of this soon; the urge to talk about kittens, the preoccupation with my weight and hair, the constant indignity of other men peering down my cleavage... it is too much!)~
